LeeAnn confirmed that recalculating the budget should now pull the correct values. A full recalculation for all students is planned for early August. Discussion about whether Pell files should already be sent. Jennifer noted Pell is easier to update than loans and should be sent if loans are already being processed. Uncertainty about whether there’s a specific date or reason for delay. LeeAnn explained the current manual process for handling official and unofficial withdrawals: Pulling reports from the registrar. Reviewing financial aid status. Performing calculations on the COD website. Entering results into Banner and Google Sheets. Kenneth requested a walkthrough of the process, which LeeAnn provided via screen sharing. Jennifer suggested using Banner’s built-in R2T4 processing to automate calculations. Benefits include: Batch processing. Pulling data directly from Banner (e.g., charges, aid, dates). Reducing manual data entry and errors. Concerns about summer term and part-of-term complexities were raised. Plan to: Set up R2T4 processing in production. Test in SI Test environment using real data. Compare Banner calculations with COD results. Gradually transition to using Banner for actual processing. Simulation mode in Banner allows safe testing before committing changes. Current process uses a custom job to notify students of R2T4 balances. Discussion about whether Banner’s Communication Manager or other tools (e.g., Argos) could replace or improve this. Jennifer confirmed that specific balance notifications are likely a federal requirement. Registrar currently populates withdrawal data for official withdrawals. Discussion about having them also handle unofficial withdrawals using the SAFA Withdrawal screen. Jennifer shared how her institution handles this with batch processing and reports. Some setup is global (per aid year), while others (like term dates and break days) must be updated each term. Kenneth requested documentation of setup tasks for each aid year and term to add to the process calendar. Jennifer will begin setup based on Ellucian documentation. Kenneth will investigate the custom job and Banner Communication Manager. LeeAnn will coordinate with the registrar and prepare break day data. Team will reconvene after fall term begins to assess progress.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/awards/r2t4"],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>1.

Over the past several months, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has assigned Reject Code 68 to records as it works to resolve a set of related processing issues. ED is working to better classify the issues that lead to this rejection so that FAAs have clear steps to resolve these cases in the near term and so that ED can implement a longer-term solution. In the meantime, this announcement lays out the causes and current next steps for resolving scenarios associated with Reject Code 68.Reject Code 68 Scenarios and Suggested Steps for RemediationWhen a Reject Code 68 error occurs, it is often paired with one of two comment codes: 329 or 303. These rejections are likely due to one of the following scenarios:Comment Code 303\nMissing Tax Filing Status:&nbsp;When the parent answers the “Parent Tax Filing Status” question as “Did not and will not file any tax return – no earned income” and a state of residence of FC (Foreign Country).\nComment Code 329\nStudentAid.gov Account is flagged:&nbsp;Occasionally, Federal Student Aid (FSA) may flag accounts to protect customers’ personally identifiable information. An update will be made in December to make the next steps clearer to the user.\nParent Paper Signature on Electronic FAFSA Form:&nbsp;When a FAFSA form that has been submitted online is rejected for a missing parent signature, a parent who then provides that signature via a paper correction will result in a Reject Code 68.\n<br>Pending Match Status:&nbsp;The user's Social Security Administration (SSA) match status in their StudentAid.gov account is listed as PENDING. This was resolved with the Aug. 3 release of real-time matching (see&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2025-06-23/2026-27-fafsa-improvements-and-beta-testing-plan-updated-august-8-2025\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2025-06-23/2026-27-fafsa-improvements-and-beta-testing-plan-updated-august-8-2025\" target=\"_self\">APP-25-18</a>), but there may still be lingering issues.\nThe following tables provide a detailed overview of each issue, how to identify it, and the potential solution.Comment Code 303Comment Code 329FAAs who have questions or continue to have issues should contact the FPS Help Desk and be ready to provide the students’ transaction IDs so that a ticket can be opened and researched further for the specific user(s).\nPhone:&nbsp;800-330-5947\nFax:&nbsp;319-665-7662\n<br>Email:&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"mailto:support@fps.ed.gov\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"mailto:support@fps.ed.gov\" target=\"_self\">support@fps.ed.gov</a>;

Trevor Ferrell 900855569.\nWe add those grant awards with detail code 80162.\nUnder the awards schedule in RPAAWRD, the award has three line items, FA/SP/SU.\nWe need to disburse this award for FA/SP only. I can certainly change it manually, but wanted you to take a look.. is the student's budget group driving the disbursement schedule for all aid?\nSorry if I am confusing - let me know your thoughts? Thanks!I’m adding Kenneth to this as well. Aid period determines the award schedule. RFRASCH is how you can set up fund code specific award schedules that are different from the default schedule for that aid period.Thanks - did not realize I left KK off!I did look at RFRASCH but did not see anything for this fund - that is why I am puzzled. Am I missing something?If you want to set up a schedule for that fund that is different than RFRDEFA, you have to set it up on RFRASCH. If there is not a fund specific schedule on RFRASCH, Banner will use the default schedule on RFRDEFA.So you’ll need to get the alternative schedule set up on RFRASCH and reschedule any awards that already exist. New awards will be split up according to RFRASCH once it is established.Got it - thanks!Sorry - last thing. I understand setting new disbursement schedules. But for this fund, we don't want anything alternative; just FA/SP 50% each. I guess my question is, why does this student have it on three disbursement schedules (FA/SP/SU) at all, if there is no alternative RFRASCH for this fund code? He is PKH, but????Because PKH RFRDEFA is set up for 3 disbursements. So it is an alternative schedule for PKH students since the normal PKH schedule is FA/SP/SU.AHH - forgot we set up RFRDEFA for PKH terms. So what is best for outside scholarships or grants, for PKHers; for us to manually adjust in RPAAWRD or use RFRASCH for PKH? I am thinking about Becky - our outside stuff is designed for FA/SP.. if we just assume summer enrollment for PKH for these funds, like we do for the fed, and set them up in RFRASCH and the student does not attend, they have lost out on funds that were initially designed to disburse in half, AND we would have to potentially return funds. My preference would be to change the disbursement to 50% FA/SP - what are your thoughts?I’d recommend setting up a FA/SP disbursement schedule for any fund code that you want to automatically schedule as 50/50. For outside scholarships, I know that’s a lot of fund codes so that may not be practical until we consolidate into the new Outside Scholarship fund codes.Thanks for the input. So far, that population does not receive the motherlode of outside aid, but it is something we should look into. The out-of-state grants, for example, can all be set up that way for sure!X Thanks again!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/awards/disbursement"],"headers":[{"heading":"2025-09-11 - Email - PKH Disbursements - Jenn &amp;

This Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) and the EAs cited herein comprise the U.S Department of Education’s (Department’s) current guidance on this topic.Other than statutory and regulatory requirements included in the document, the contents of this guidance do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.Types of InformationIt is important to understand the distinctions between the types of data mentioned above because there are different usage rules for each data type under the HEA, IRC, and FERPA. When determining whether a use or disclosure is allowable, the most restrictive statute applies.\n<br>FAFSA data&nbsp;is all information entered on the application or transferred from the previous year’s application. It also includes most data that the FAFSA Processing System (FPS) derives from the application, such as Federal Pell Grant eligibility and the Student Aid Index (SAI). In general, FAFSA data is what appears on the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) that is not FTI. For a full list of the ISIR information, see the&nbsp;ISIR Guide, which is Volume 6 of the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/handbooks-manuals-or-guides/2023-05-31/2024-25-fafsa-specifications-guide-february-2025-update-2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/handbooks-manuals-or-guides/2023-05-31/2024-25-fafsa-specifications-guide-february-2025-update-2\" target=\"_self\"><em></em></a>FAFSA Specifications Guide. FTI&nbsp;is all the data received from the IRS via the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) as well as data that the FPS directly derives that could be used to reverse calculate FTI, such as the student or parent payroll tax allowance. These items are specifically listed in EA GENERAL-23-34; the FA-DDX items were included when the EA was originally published in 2023, and the directly derived data were added at the beginning of 2025. The EA also explains the protocol for handling FTI, which includes labeling it as “CUI//SP-TAX” (Controlled Unclassified Information/Specified Tax). The Department will label FTI fields on the ISIR, and FTI must also be labeled as CUI//SP-TAX by our partners; these labels must follow FTI wherever it is accessed, stored, or redisclosed with the written consent of the student as explained below. Note that not all tax data are FTI; manually entered tax data, such as those from a foreign tax return or from an IRS return that was not eligible for the data exchange, are considered FAFSA data. The&nbsp;FUTURE Act&nbsp;allowed the Department for the first time to maintain FTI in its systems; the FTI must be used and safeguarded according to the strict requirements of the IRC and the HEA. Prior to the 2024–2025 award year, when the FA-DDX was implemented, all tax data were considered FAFSA data, even when transferred by the now-retired IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT), because it was either directly entered by the student or parent or, in the case of the DRT, they agreed to the transfer of the data from the IRS, which they then could view and edit. In the current environment, they are not able to view or edit data transferred via the FA-DDX. Non-FAFSA, institutional, or school data&nbsp;are the terms for information that is originated by schools or other entities. This includes total aid awarded, grant and loan receipt and amounts, and unmet financial need. While some of this information, such as Pell Grant receipt and amount, is reported to Department systems, such as the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS®), it is not considered FAFSA data because it originates from schools rather than from the ISIR. By contrast, Pell Grant eligibility is considered FAFSA data since it is part of the ISIR and is derived from information entered on the FAFSA form. In this context, the IRC governs the use and access of FTI, while the HEA and the&nbsp;Privacy Act&nbsp;cover FAFSA data use as well as FTI.<br>The&nbsp;Privacy Act&nbsp;applies to federal agencies and governs information about individuals that is in a “record” contained in a “system of records” (see 5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(a)(1)–(7), (b), and (e)). Information that the&nbsp;Privacy Act&nbsp;protects cannot be disclosed by federal agencies without prior written consent unless one of the statutory exceptions applies. Under one exception, a federal agency may publish in the&nbsp;Federal Register&nbsp;a “routine use” for the information in a system of records notice (SORN) that outlines how the agency may disclose the information without prior written consent so long as the routine use is compatible with the purpose for which the agency collected the information. The Department’s routine uses for FAFSA data are outlined in the Aid Awareness and Application Processing (AAAP)&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/30/2024-11852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/30/2024-11852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records\" target=\"_self\">(18-11-21) SORN</a>, and the routine uses for FTI data are outlined in the FUTURE Act System (FAS)&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/06/29/2023-13980/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/06/29/2023-13980/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records\" target=\"_self\">(18-11-23) SORN</a>.FERPA and its implementing regulations protect the privacy of student education records at all educational institutions and agencies that receive funds under a&nbsp;Department&nbsp;program. This protection encompasses FTI and FAFSA data as well as an institution’s financial aid records on a student. FERPA is more broadly applicable, but generally less restrictive, than the HEA and IRC.The Department’s FERPA regulations (see 34 C.F.R. § 99.3) define education records, parent, and student, noting that the latter means anyone who is attending or has attended an educational agency or institution and for whom the agency or institution maintains education records. A person’s records at a school he or she has applied to but not attended are therefore not education records protected by FERPA. When a student reaches 18 years of age or attends a school at any age, he or she becomes an “eligible student,” and all rights accorded to, and consent required of, parents under FERPA transfer from the parent to the student. (34 C.F.R. §§ 99.3, 99.5(a)(1)).FTI and FAFSA Data Use Without Additional Student Consent<br>It is helpful to separate those activities that schools and state agencies are entitled to and expected to perform without additional consent from students (beyond the approval students provide when completing the FAFSA form) from those activities that require such consent. See EA&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-12-20/guidance-consent-fafsa-data-sharing-and-automatic-idr-certification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-12-20/guidance-consent-fafsa-data-sharing-and-automatic-idr-certification\" target=\"_self\">GENERAL-24-149</a>&nbsp;for guidance about the form and collection methods of this additional consent. We also discuss it further below.Application, Award, and Administration of Aid:&nbsp;Schools and state agencies and their respective contractors may receive and use FTI and FAFSA data for the application, award, and administration of financial aid, consistent with the HEA,&nbsp;Privacy Act, and FERPA, and as outlined in their Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) agreements. According to HEA section 483, state agencies are to use FTI and FAFSA data “solely for the application, award, and administration of state-based financial aid for which the applicant is eligible,” while schools are to use the same information “solely for the application, award, and administration of financial aid to the applicant.” The language in both cases is similar though more general for schools, which are responsible for creating and administering a student’s entire aid package, while the purview of state agencies is to focus on their own aid programs. The law also specifies research uses for FAFSA data, which will be explained further below. The Department interprets “the application, award, and administration of aid” to be the administrative and business functions necessary to deliver federal, state, and institutional financial aid efficiently and effectively to students. These functions may include but are not limited to:\nmanaging aid applications, eligibility, verification, and packaging and assisting students with those processes; processing and disbursing federal, state, or institutional financial aid; monitoring the academic progress of aid &nbsp;recipients and enforcing other aid requirements (e.g., satisfactory academic progress &nbsp;or SAP); complying with mandatory reporting for participation in aid programs, such as the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) reporting and net price calculator publishing under HEA sections 487 and 132 respectively; performing analyses necessary to the administration of financial aid programs by leveraging FTI and FAFSA data to estimate and model how financial aid will be allocated by the school or state agency; and conducting audits and program evaluations necessary for the efficient and effective administration of those student aid programs. The above duties are largely, but not entirely, school functions, and often the financial aid office performs them, but other personnel in offices or programs within a school who have duties related to the application, award, or administration of financial aid will be involved too. This includes, but is not limited to, those in the admissions and business (or bursar’s) offices, support programs, athletic and academic departments (e.g., awarding scholarships), and offices responsible for mandatory monitoring and reporting related to aid administration (e.g., SAP and IPEDS). Also included are contractors administering any aspect of a school’s or state agency’s aid-related activities; the contractors must assume all appropriate safeguards and responsibilities, including liability for any civil and criminal penalties under the HEA, IRC, and&nbsp;Privacy Act.In handling FTI and FAFSA data, the principle of “least privilege” should apply. Users should only have access to and make use of the data if it is necessary for them to perform their duties related to the application, award, and administration of aid or, for FAFSA data, applicable research. This will minimize potential security risks and breaches. The SAIG agreements schools and state agencies signed clarify who can access and use FAFSA data and FTI. The authorized personnel mentioned in state agency SAIG agreements and the administrators described in school SAIG agreements must be under the direct control of or bound by written agreement to the state agency or school. The SAIG agreements detail the responsibilities of authorized personnel and administrators and any penalties that might apply for failure to execute those responsibilities.Because of the special sensitivity of FTI and the penalties involved for even inadvertently mishandling the data, schools and state agencies should limit those accessing FTI to financial aid administrators (FAAs) as much as possible even though a variety of offices may have duties related to the application, award, and administration of aid. For example, a school’s financial aid office should use FTI to calculate eligibility for monetary scholarships that might be administered by other parts of the institution such as athletics or academic departments or an alumni association. Offices like institutional research that hold responsibility for required reporting such as IPEDS are permitted to access FTI, but the school must ensure they have taken all necessary steps to ensure the appropriate use of FTI, which also includes ensuring staff fully understand their responsibilities for protecting FTI. All individuals within a school or state agency who access FTI are required to take all applicable training.<br>In addition, the Department will ensure the security of FTI by holding schools and state agencies to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final\" target=\"_self\">Special Publication 800.171, Rev. 3</a>&nbsp;(Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations) CUI security standards, and they, in turn, will be required to ensure that any external entities that receive FTI from them are held to the same standards. This requirement may narrow the outside entities that are able to receive FTI because they may not meet the NIST standards and because the school or state agency may lack the oversight to ensure compliance. The Department will provide more information about this requirement in the future. As of the publication of this letter, there are not yet any compliance obligations regarding NIST SP 800.171.Research:&nbsp;Both state agencies and schools can use FAFSA data,&nbsp;but not FTI, to perform research without student consent as long as the research activities pertain to college attendance, persistence, and completion. The research cannot release any individually identifiable information about students. Contractors or third-party servicers that otherwise already have access to student FAFSA data due to their role in aid application, award, and administration may also perform this research under the direction of the school or state agency. This could involve, for example, a school using student-level FAFSA data to conduct a study about program completion of Pell-eligible students, as long as any results of the study that are released do not contain any identifiable information about the students involved.This function can also include the creation of de-identified, aggregate statistics (of FAFSA data but not FTI) that a school makes publicly available by posting them to its website or releasing them to another party for the purpose of college attendance, persistence, and completion, such as an organization that uses the statistics to provide the public more information about the schools that released them. Such statistics are a research product that is being used with the implicit purpose of encouraging attendance at the schools that publish them.FAFSA Completion Efforts:&nbsp;State agencies, in collaboration with local education agencies (LEAs) or secondary schools, may use&nbsp;only students' identifying information&nbsp;from the FAFSA form to check if a graduating student has submitted the application. Per the state agency SAIG agreement, identifying information means: the applicant’s first and last name, date of birth, and ZIP code; FAFSA submitted and processed dates; selected for verification flag; and a FAFSA completion flag as determined by the state agency (e.g., FAFSA not submitted, FAFSA complete, or FAFSA incomplete). The state agency should consult its SAIG agreement for more details on how to properly redisclose and use identifying information from the FAFSA form for this purpose. The LEA or secondary school must comply, as applicable, with FERPA requirements if it discloses any personally identifiable information (PII) from students’ education records to the state agency. There is no provision in the HEA for colleges performing this function.<br>Means-tested Benefits Outreach:&nbsp;As explained in EA&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-07-29/guidance-means-tested-benefits-outreach-institutions-and-state-grant-agencies\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-07-29/guidance-means-tested-benefits-outreach-institutions-and-state-grant-agencies\" target=\"_self\">GENERAL-24-93</a>, state agencies and schools can use FAFSA data such as the Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant eligibility to determine which students they will contact about possible eligibility for means-tested benefits like the Child Tax Credit and Medicaid. They should minimize the FAFSA information and number of personnel needed for this function.Designated Scholarship Organizations:&nbsp;While this DCL is concerned with institutions of higher education and state agencies, it bears noting that HEA section 483(a)(2)(D) refers to scholarship organizations that are authorized to receive ISIR data, including FTI, directly from the Department due to a prior designation from the Secretary of Education. There are only two: the United Negro College Fund and Hispanic Scholarship Fund can receive ISIR data without additional prior written consent of the applicant. However, these entities are not permitted to further disclose FAFSA data or FTI for any other purpose beyond the application, award, and administration of their specific aid programs. They will also be required to adhere to the NIST SP 800.171 CUI security standards in their handling of FTI.FTI and FAFSA Data Use that Requires Student ConsentAs noted above, the consent process is described in EA GENERAL-24-149, and it applies to both schools and state agencies. However, there are some differences between what the obtaining of student consent allows the two kinds of organizations to do.Sharing Data for Assistance from Government Agencies and Other Entities:&nbsp;Under HEA section 483, state agencies, with student consent, may share FAFSA data (excluding FTI) with federal, state, local government agencies, or tribal organizations to help students receive assistance for any component of the cost of attendance (COA). That may include financial or non-monetary assistance, including means-tested benefits. A public college or university that qualifies as a government agency (i.e., its employees are government employees) may be eligible for this redisclosure by a state higher education agency. This would be helpful, for instance, for TRIO programs that are run by public institutions (not private nonprofit or for-profit schools) but that do not already have access to FAFSA data because they do not provide monetary support to students and therefore do not participate in the application, award, and administration of aid. Such TRIO programs could receive FAFSA data from the state agency with written consent.Under HEA section 494, schools that obtain student consent may share&nbsp;both&nbsp;FAFSA data and FTI with the same organizations as state agencies, to help students receive financial assistance (but not non-monetary assistance), including means-tested benefits, for any component of the COA. And unlike state agencies, schools may also share FAFSA data and FTI with external scholarship-granting organizations, including tribal organizations. This highlights schools’ wider purview in coordinating the entire financial aid package for students, including the scholarships provided by non-governmental organizations. However, as stated, schools will be required to ensure that any external entities that receive FTI are held to the NIST SP 800-171 CUI security standards.Any person or organization receiving such information from state agencies or schools may only use that information for the express purpose(s) intended by the students’ consent.School-only Provisions With Student Consent:&nbsp;There are a few actions that apply only to schools. Normally students who complete an application will receive a FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS, the document that replaced the Student Aid Report mentioned in the law) that lists the data they entered on the application but does not contain their FTI. Under the HEA, students who give consent can receive a complete, unredacted copy of their record that includes their FTI (likely a copy of their ISIR) from their school, and they are free to further disclose that document as they choose.Also, students who provide consent may have a discussion of their FAFSA data and FTI with their school that includes an advisor or other individual that they choose to participate in the discussion, which may be someone internal or external to the institution, such as TRIO or other program personnel.As noted above, a third-party servicer that has access to FAFSA data may perform research pertaining to college attendance, persistence, and completion on behalf of a school or state agency. Under HEA section 483(a)(3)(C)(iii), a school may,&nbsp;with student consent, share FAFSA data but not FTI with an external entity that is not a third-party servicer to perform that research.As with governmental agencies and scholarship organizations receiving information with student consent, the advisor and the external research entity mentioned above shall only use the information they receive for the purpose for which consent was granted by the student.A scholarship-granting organization, government or tribal agency, or the advisor mentioned above that receives information via a school that has obtained a student’s written consent cannot redisclose the information to any other person without the additional express written permission of, or request by, the student.FERPA and the Use of Non-FAFSA or Institutional DataAs explained above, information that is not created by the Department but that may reside in Department systems is considered non-FAFSA or school data and is not governed by the same HEA or IRC restrictions as FAFSA data and FTI. Because the HEA and IRC are more restrictive than FERPA regarding the use of FAFSA data and FTI, it was not necessary in that discussion to explain how that use satisfies the FERPA statutes and regulations. However, when determining the uses of institutional data, on which the IRC and HEA are silent, it is necessary to discuss the FERPA rules.<br>As outlined in the Department’s&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/eligible-student-guide-family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/eligible-student-guide-family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa\" target=\"_self\"><em></em></a>An Eligible Student Guide to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a school may not disclose PII from eligible students’ education records without their prior written consent unless an exception to the consent requirement is met. The Department’s FERPA regulations (see&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99/subpart-D/section-99.31\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99/subpart-D/section-99.31\" target=\"_self\">34 CFR 99.31</a>) describe the exceptions to general consent, such as disclosures to school officials who the school has determined have legitimate educational interests in the education records; disclosures in connection with an eligible student’s application for, or receipt of, financial aid; and disclosures to organizations conducting certain types of studies for, or on behalf of, the school. Please note that this guidance does not provide comprehensive details of all the requirements necessary to implement a FERPA exception (e.g., both the studies and audit or evaluation exceptions under FERPA have requirements for what must be included in a written agreement). More information on these requirements can be found through the Department’s&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/\" target=\"_self\">student privacy website.</a>&nbsp;<br>It may benefit schools to use institutional data instead of similar FAFSA data if they are able because that could offer more flexibility. Consider, for example, a school that wanted to have an outside researcher do work under the FERPA studies exception that examined Pell-eligible students. If the school sorted the students according to those to whom it disbursed Pell Grants rather than those whose ISIRs had a Pell eligibility flag of Y, it would not need student consent because the former is school data while the latter is FAFSA data from the ISIR. As noted above, the studies exception mandates the criteria that must be met, such as what the studies can cover and the details of the agreement between the school and the outside researcher. See&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99/subpart-D/section-99.31#p-99.31(a)(6)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99/subpart-D/section-99.31#p-99.31(a)(6)\" target=\"_self\">§99.31(a)(6)</a>.Similar rationales about the flexibility available for the use of school data can be made for other FERPA exceptions, such as the school official exception. For example, while schools could use FAFSA data and FTI to administer a TRIO program like Student Support Services because it offers funds to students, which falls under the application, award, and administration of aid, FAFSA data and FTI cannot be used to determine eligibility for TRIO programs that do not offer aid. In those cases, it might be possible to use non-FAFSA data and the school official exception to determine student eligibility for non-monetary TRIO benefits, such as tutoring and counseling.<br>Correcting the FAFSA:&nbsp;Under FERPA, eligible students have the right to seek to amend inaccurate information in their education records. For FAFSA data, this is accomplished either by students or FAAs according to the guidance in Chapter 4 of the Application and Verification Guide, a volume of the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/fsa-handbook\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/fsa-handbook\" target=\"_self\">FSA Handbook</a>. However, while FTI is part of a student’s education record, because the Department received it directly from the IRS and shared it with schools, it is by definition accurate tax data, and there is no correcting it. Students who believe their SAI has been calculated incorrectly should contact their school financial aid office. If they are contesting the accuracy of their FTI, the school should refer them to the IRS. If they need to file an amended tax return, the school can refer them to a tax professional.In cases where students request and are granted a professional judgment (PJ) adjustment by their school because the FTI, which is from the prior-prior year, does not reflect their current financial situation, the action that the FAA takes suppresses the FTI in the ISIR and instead uses more current income information. In PJ situations, because the tax data is provided by the student (or parent or spouse), it is considered FAFSA data rather than FTI.Certain NSLDS Data Use Provisions Unchanged:&nbsp;It is important to note that neither the&nbsp;FUTURE Act&nbsp;nor the&nbsp;FAFSA Simplification Act&nbsp;amended some specific prohibitions in the HEA. Paragraph (d)(2) of Section 485B of the HEA still prohibits nongovernmental researchers and policy analysts from accessing PII from NSLDS, and paragraph (d)(5)(B) still prohibits the use of NSLDS data for marketing purposes.Student Consent<br>The guidance above refers to two consent processes: one for the disclosure of information under FERPA and one for HEA disclosures. The regulations explain the contents of student consent under FERPA in&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99/subpart-D/section-99.30\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99/subpart-D/section-99.30\" target=\"_self\">§99.30</a>, and the HEA explains what student consent for FTI/FAFSA data sharing must contain in section 494(c)(4)(B). Institutions of higher education can use the same process to obtain written consent that adheres to the requirements of the HEA and FERPA from applicants who are eligible students under both statutes.Under the HEA, written consent requires a separate, written document (which may be in an electronic format) signed and dated by the applicant. The written consent must state the information being disclosed, and if that includes FTI it must specifically say so. The consent must also state the purpose for the disclosure and that the information may only be used for this purpose. Written consent is required to be maintained for a period of at least three years from the student’s last date of attendance at the institution and made available to the Department upon request.Written consent from an eligible student under FERPA must specify the records that may be disclosed, state the purpose of the disclosure, and identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made. Upon students' request, the agency or institution shall provide them with a copy of the records disclosed. The signed and dated consent may be in an electronic form that identifies and authenticates the students as the source of the electronic consent and indicates their approval of the information contained in it.For More Information<br>The Department appreciates stakeholders’ cooperation and continued role in safeguarding the integrity of the&nbsp;Title IV&nbsp;programs and protecting the sensitive information, including FTI, provided by students and their families.

The challenge of reducing student phone calls asking, \"Have you received my FAFSA?\" The relationship and timing dependencies between Banner (RawRec), Info Access, and Student Forms. Clarification of the process for loading and locking ISIRs with High School Diploma or GED updates. A procedural issue where manually updated locked records (from the needs analysis report) are skipped by the nightly tracking group process. A procedural issue with ISIR suspense processing, where manually matched records can be lost if a nightly process is skipped. (Kenneth, on behalf of Allison) How can students see that we have received their FAFSA? (Jennifer) They cannot see it while the aid year is invisible. Once the aid year is visible, it is tracked on RawRec. (Dawn) Where do we set up the estimated budgets for 26-27? (Kenneth) In an \"RPB\" form. He confirmed Leanne has not put them in yet. (Kenneth) If we turn on Info Access... is that going to show things we don't want them seeing? (Jennifer) It is unlikely, as packaging has not started. (Kenneth) What is Student Forms going to start showing them [once ISIRs are loaded]? (Jennifer) It will show the requirements attached to any comment codes, such as verification or C-Flags. (Kenneth) Jonathan, can you explain... why we're locking the high school and GED updates? (Jonathan) A high school diploma or equivalent is a Title IV eligibility requirement. If a student corrects their FAFSA, that corrected ISIR must be on record to process their loans and Pell Grants to remain in compliance. (Jennifer) That makes sense why you would load them, but why are you locking them? (Jonathan) His initial answer was based on already-packaged students, believing the ISIR needed to be locked to be the one used for disbursing aid. (Jennifer) Why would you need that locked if they haven't even been packaged yet? (Jonathan) He acknowledged this was a misunderstanding. He had not realized that non-packaged records are not locked and that their updates (like a high school correction) are loaded automatically. (Kenneth) Do you [Jennifer] want to... create a way to pick those [manually updated locked records] up... to get their batch post done? (Jennifer) Yes, she will work on a way to identify and include them in the process. (Dawn) What happens if suspense doesn't get completed that day? Or... say the suspense didn't get done one day... What happens to those? (Jennifer) As long as \"Data Load Part 3\" (RCRTP) has not been run, the records sit in the match. However, if the nightly chain runs its own match (RCP) before Dawn's records are loaded, her manual matching work will be undone and put back in suspense. (Dawn) So, is there a problem if... we do not process that night because we're stopping processes for Kathy? (Jennifer) Yes. The people from that day's load won't be run through the tracking group process. High School/GED ISIR Locking: The process will be simplified. Prematurely locking ISIRs for non-packaged students is unnecessary and will stop. The ISIR update will load automatically and become the current record. For packaged (locked) students, Dawn will no longer perform a separate review for high school/GED updates. These updates will be handled during her standard \"locked records\" (needs analysis) review. If there is no SAI change, the new ISIR will be loaded (and re-locked) as part of that existing process. ISIR Suspense Process: A new automated process was approved to handle manually matched suspense records. The \"Data Load Part 3\" (RCRTP) step will be added to the beginning of the nightly ISIR load chain. This will load all of Dawn's manually matched records (giving them the current date) before the chain pulls in and processes the new daily ISIR file. Task: Enter the 26-27 estimated budgets. [Owner: Dawn (working with Leanne), Deadline: Next week, when Leanne returns]. Task: Follow the new, simplified procedure for handling ISIRs with High School/GED updates (i.e., stop premature locking and handle updates during the normal locked-record review). [Owner: Dawn, Deadline: Ongoing].

I'd have to go look at the...Dawn: So, are we sure that Leanne has not put it in there?Kenneth Kirksey: Yes.Dawn: Okay, so because those are going to... we basically have them.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Dawn: So we just needed to put them in there.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Dawn: Okay, I'll work with her next week when she comes back on that.Kenneth Kirksey: So, if we're not running the tracking group process, they're not going to see that we've got their FAFSA.Jennifer Buckles: Right. Although, I think there is a piece of the ISIR load that actually adds that to tracking, and it's not a batch post. But again, while it's invisible, they can't see anything.Kenneth Kirksey: But if we turn on Info Access... is that going to show things we don't want them seeing?Jennifer Buckles: I can't imagine. I mean, because you're not packaging yet, right?Kenneth Kirksey: Nope.Jennifer Buckles: So, if you turned on Info Access and you had not run the batch posting yet, then there would be nothing for them to see.Jennifer Buckles: Then once you run batch posting, they would be able to see their tracking requirements, and then that's going to then push them to Student Forms. If you haven't uploaded your ISIRs to Student Forms yet, you could have a disconnect there. So you just kind of need to make sure before you post tracking codes that are going to direct them elsewhere to complete requirements, you're ready for them to actually complete those requirements. Like, if it's linked to a form, like a PDF or something, that that form is correct, or if it's linked to Student Forms, that those ISIRs have been loaded. So you kind of have to align all of that and push it out all at once.But I believe the FAFSA gets tracked in your actual ISIR load, not the grouping batch post process.Kenneth Kirksey: So, and that got me thinking, too, if we start loading these, Student Forms is going to pick them up as well.Jennifer Buckles: Yes, unless the file is not in whatever folder it's looking for at the time it looks for it.Kenneth Kirksey: And so, what is Student Forms going to start showing them?Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, it won't show anything until you load the ISIR there.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, and once they've loaded the ISIRs... it's going to show... comment codes?Jennifer Buckles: Well, the requirements attached to any comment codes, yeah. So when they log in, it'll automatically show them whatever they need to complete, whether it's verification or C-Flag or whatever.Kenneth Kirksey: And, but since we haven't... weren't running the tracking process, we're not going to have those in RawRec.Jennifer Buckles: Correct. But if the student goes into Student Forms, and you have Student Forms turned on to where they can go in and access their 26-27 ISIR there, you have logic APIs set up that will push that action tracking code back to Banner, if it doesn't already exist.But the thing with that is, they don't know to get in there—for new students anyway—unless you have the tracking code on Banner. Returning students would already have an account, and so they might get a reminder email or a notification email because they've already set up their phone number and email and attached themselves to an ISIR. But new students wouldn't have had the opportunity to do that yet. So, some students can get in there and get notifications early if you've got it turned on, and then new students wouldn't be able to unless you've got the tracking code in Banner.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, yeah, and I think we have new students interacting with Slate, not self-service.Jennifer Buckles: But they still... does Slate show them their financial aid requirements from RawRec?Kenneth Kirksey: I don't think so.Jennifer Buckles: So they have to get into self-service at some point to do their financial aid requirements.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah. Which I think is... that's once they've been admitted.Kenneth Kirksey: What Allison just wants to stop is all the phone calls asking, \"Have you received my FAFSA yet?\"Jennifer Buckles: Yeah. I don't know that there's a good way to do that, because even if you make it visible, they're still going to call. They're still going to ask. You could push out an email notification to say, \"Hey, we got it,\" but they're still going to call. They just don't read the notification. You're still going to have those that are extremely concerned and want to make sure it's there. But, I mean, you could make it as transparent as possible, and that might cut down on some of them.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah. Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: All right, well, to the topic at hand. Jonathan, can you explain what you said in the meeting the other day about why we're locking the high school and GED updates?Jonathan Ibarra: Yes, so, one of the general eligibility criteria for students to be able to receive Title IV aid is they have to have a high school diploma or equivalency, like a GED. And on their FAFSA applications, there has to be a response that indicates that they do.But this was one of the issues that was, maybe in 24-25 when it all started, where students were reporting \"none of the above.\" So, because of that, it puts them ineligible to receive Title IV aid, or even for us to disperse. So for those students that are indicating that, we're basically telling them that they need to make a correction. And a lot of times, they do have a high school diploma or GED, but for whatever reason, their answers are coming out as \"none of the above.\"But for students that do make the correction, we do need to have that ISIR, just because in order for us to issue their Title IV aid, we need to have that on record. Otherwise, if we get an ISIR that does not have that, we're not able to process their loans, nor would we be able to issue their Pell Grants. And if we do, then we're out of compliance because we're not technically allowed to issue their aid if they don't have that answer questioned correctly.Jennifer Buckles: That makes sense why you would load them, but why are you locking them?Jonathan Ibarra: In terms of locking it, the reason why is because we need to have that when we send the files for loans. We need to have that as the ISIR that we're using, as well as for Pell. Otherwise, if we're not, we're still utilizing the ISIR from the prior one that is causing the whole issue, which is the ATB that comes into play.Jennifer Buckles: It doesn't need to be locked to be loaded. So, like, thinking of students not even packaged yet. Dawn's instructions were \"lock them, no matter what. Packaged, not packaged, doesn't matter. Lock the ISIR.\" Why would you need that locked if they haven't even been packaged yet?Jonathan Ibarra: I'm going based on ones that have already been packaged, but we can't disperse their aid. Not the ones that haven't.Jennifer Buckles: Okay, I mean, because when she asked for clarification, like, \"even if they haven't been packaged, you want them locked?\" You said yes. So that's where the confusion's coming from.Jonathan Ibarra: Oh, okay. I... let me think. I think I said that just because even if they haven't been packaged, if we're getting an ISIR update just because the reason behind it is because they updated the high school, we would still want that. There shouldn't really be any change of their SAI whatsoever.Jennifer Buckles: Right. If they're not packaged, that update of their high school is automatically loaded. The only reason it's not loaded is if it's locked already. The only reason it's locked is if it's been packaged. So, if we're talking about people who have not been packaged yet, that means their ISIR's not locked. Any updates are going to automatically get loaded, so they're automatically made the current record.So there's no reason to go in and lock it if they haven't been packaged. That new transaction with the high school update automatically made the current... it's there. It's the current record. And then maybe they're still in verification or whatever. Once that gets completed, they get packaged, and then that gets locked. But by locking it prematurely, you're kind of making Dawn do more work to review locked records that she doesn't necessarily need to do.Jonathan Ibarra: Okay, I see what you mean. That's on my end, because I think my response was more so of, \"we want to utilize that transaction,\" but not-realizing that some of those records that haven't been packaged have not been locked.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah. And then, if they have already been locked, and the ISIR comes in with a high school update, she would automatically be reviewing them in the SAI change process. So she's looking at all locked records that have a new update. She's looking at them regardless of the reason. She's looking at every single one of them and going through an SAI comparison. If there's no SAI change whatsoever, she's loading it. Just loading it, and locking that, because it was previously locked.So, she wouldn't necessarily need to go back through and then look for high school updates, because they would have already been loaded. The only ones that wouldn't be loaded is if they came in, they maybe changed their high school, and then changed something on their income, and that changed their SAI. And for those, you wouldn't want her to load them, because they need to do the FAFSA change first.Jonathan Ibarra: Absolutely. Yeah, so, like, in the past, we have had this issue where we had students asking us, \"Hey, I submitted my correction, can you please process my award,\" and I can see that we have the ISIRs, but it's not being currently used. So that's where the conversation of, \"if we do get an update ISIR and it does reflect high school, we definitely want to use it.\" But that was just more so because I didn't find them and knowing the ones that did do the correction.Jennifer Buckles: Because in the past, she wouldn't load them unless there was a reason to load them. Now, she's loading them unless there's a reason not to.Jonathan Ibarra: Correct, yeah.Jennifer Buckles: So, I don't think she needs to go through and specifically look for high school updates anymore, because they'll automatically get loaded. And if they don't, there's a reason, like an SAI change or there's something wrong with it.Jonathan Ibarra: That makes sense.Jennifer Buckles: So, I think, Dawn, you can take that review... just look at all your locked records like you normally do. Any GED or high school updates would be in that group, and as long as there's no SAI change, you're loading them automatically. And if they're not already locked, they automatically get loaded. So they're already automatically made the current record. So I don't think you need to go back behind them and lock them prematurely before they're packaged. That simplifies that locked records process that needs analysis a little bit, anyway.Kenneth Kirksey: We'll take any simplifications we can.Jennifer Buckles: But if you notice, like, after doing this, if you notice something's not getting loaded, revisit. Because you should not have records coming in with only high school and GED changes that are not loaded. If that's the only thing changing, whether they were locked prior or not locked prior, they should be loaded regardless. So you should not have an issue going forward, and Dawn won't have to do anything special to make sure they're loaded, because they'll just get loaded in the regular review that she does. But if something happens, and it's like, \"Okay, this should have been loaded and it's not,\" let's go circle back and revisit, because that shouldn't be happening.Jonathan Ibarra: That makes sense.Kenneth Kirksey: And while we were on here... Dawn, I'd emailed Jen yesterday about those students with the verification requirement that weren't in a verified tracking group. And she reminded me, those are the ones that you've worked in suspense, and so they're not getting re-run through the tracking process.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, it's the ones that she's working in the locked records. Because the suspense ones do get run through. Because it goes by the date the ISIR was loaded. And so when she works suspense today, she's actually loading those ISIRs today, the ones she's matching. So they have a date of today. Even though technically the ISIR was pulled in yesterday or last night, it didn't get actually loaded to an ID until today. And so those get stamped with today's date. Then tonight, when the ISIR load runs, it picks those up and runs them through the group. So suspense is fine.Jennifer Buckles: But it's the ones that she's doing on the needs analysis report. Those get loaded last night, but they aren't made the active ISIR, the current record, because they were previously locked. So when she's doing the review of the locked records, she's making ISIRs that were loaded yesterday current today, but they still have a load date of yesterday. And so they don't get picked up in tonight's process.So, Kenneth, I was going to ask you, do you want me to try to create a way to pick those up, kind of in a separate group and run them through as well, or include them in the overall group, to get their batch post done so we don't have to do that manually?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Jennifer Buckles: I think we'd be able to identify them. If nothing else, we could just look for... well, I don't know. I have to think of how we might be able to pick those up. I was trying to think, maybe we could look for an ID other than Banworks that has made a change to it. Maybe that would pick this group up. But I might have to play around with that a little bit.Dawn: What happens if suspense doesn't get completed that day? Or say there's a duplicate PID that has to be resolved before you get it matched, and it's matched, say, a week from now? Or, you know, say the suspense didn't get done one day, and it's maybe Monday before it gets done. What happens to those?Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, the important part is that \"data load part 3\" that you do after you match it. So, once that data load part 3 runs, that's the date stamp that they get. So if that's not done... like if they, for some reason, they haven't applied yet... they don't apply for a month, and you're holding on to their ISIR for a month, or whatever, there's an issue and it sits in there. As long as it's sitting in there, it's fine. The date you run that data load 3 and actually load it, that's the date that the ISIR was loaded or created in Banner, and that's the date that all the processes—the grouping process and the pop-selects that run them through the batch post—that's the date it uses.Dawn: So, is there a problem if, for example, say I run the RCR to load everything, and then we do not process that night because we're stopping processes for Kathy? Is that a problem?Jennifer Buckles: Yeah. Then those people won't get run through grouping.Dawn: And then if I don't do it, then I have to redo the suspense all over again, because they'll just go back. So what do we do about that? Just don't do suspense on the days that we know that we're not processing for Kathy or something?Jennifer Buckles: Do you know that ahead of time?Dawn: We do.Jennifer Buckles: I think if you know it ahead of time, you could. I'd want to think through this a little bit, but I was thinking, what if you ran your match... you did all your matching up for whatever pieces you're doing, and you didn't load? You didn't run that data load 3. But we add a data load 3 to the beginning of the ISIR chain. So it would load any that you had previously matched before it runs the match again.So it would load anything that you had done. Then it would pull in the new file, run the match, load the new file. Then it would pick up everybody. So it would pick up anything that was in the match from when you did it—whether you matched them two days ago or today—because you didn't load them, they just sit there in the match until they're actually loaded or the match is run again.Dawn: Oh, I see what you're saying. I can run the match, but if I don't run the RCR for a couple of days, they still... they don't go back to...Jennifer Buckles: As long as the match isn't run again. So what I'm saying is...Dawn: Oh, run the RCR before you run the...Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, in the automatic process. Right now, you run... there's the RCP where you import the file, you run the match, then you run the RCR (RCRTP) to load them. If you left it like that, once you run that match, it's going to undo anything you had done and not loaded.But, if we do RCR first to load anything you previously matched, then pull in the new file, then re-run the match, then run the data load part 3 to actually load the new file, everybody in that group—including the ones you matched and the ones that the new process matched—they would all have today's date on them, and so they'd all get picked up.Kenneth Kirksey: What is the Data Load 3?Dawn: The RCRTP, is that what you're talking about?Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. So that runs as part of the chain. Are you running it again after you...Dawn: After I do the RCP match, I have to run the RCR to actually load them.Jennifer Buckles: Because if she doesn't, and we just let the chain run, when it hits that RCP match, it basically re-runs the match, and it undoes whatever manual matching she's done in suspense. It'll run them back through the rules and then put them back in suspense again. So, that's why you have to load that data load part 3 to actually say, \"Okay, take this match and save it and load it into that student's record.\"So if you added that Part 3 first, that would save Dawn from having to run it at all. She could just do match, match, match, and then she'd be done. When the ISIR load chain runs that night, it runs Data Load Part 3 to load any from Dawn's match, then it runs the normal \"load the ISIR file, run the match, run the load.\" And then everything from both of those loads would have today's date on them.Kenneth Kirksey: That makes sense.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah. And then it wouldn't matter if you had to skip a day, or if something happened and the process didn't run, you wouldn't lose all those records, whether she had loaded them or not.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, well, you can add that to your work-on things.Jennifer Buckles: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: All right. Did y'all have any other questions or anything?Jonathan Ibarra: Nope, but I do apologize for the confusion that I caused.Kenneth Kirksey: If we all knew what we were doing, this wouldn't be financial aid.Jennifer Buckles: I'll just clarify: Dawn, just keep doing what you're doing until we get the new process for the data load part updated, because I don't want to lose any of those records.Dawn: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. All right. We'll see y'all later.Dawn: Thanks, guys.Jonathan Ibarra: Thanks.Kenneth Kirksey: Bye.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/isir_processing"],"headers":[{"heading":"Financial Aid Process Review","level":1,"id":"Financial_Aid_Process_Review_0"},{"heading":"Student FAFSA Visibility","level":2,"id":"Student_FAFSA_Visibility_0"},{"heading":"Allison's Question: How Students See FAFSA Receipt","level":3,"id":"Allison's_Question_How_Students_See_FAFSA_Receipt_0"},{"heading":"Sidetopic: 26-27 Estimated Budgets","level":3,"id":"Sidetopic_26-27_Estimated_Budgets_0"},{"heading":"Current Process Limitations","level":3,"id":"Current_Process_Limitations_0"},{"heading":"The Role of Info Access and Student Forms","level":3,"id":"The_Role_of_Info_Access_and_Student_Forms_0"},{"heading":"The \"Disconnect\" Problem for New vs. Returning Students","level":3,"id":"The_\"Disconnect\"_Problem_for_New_vs._Returning_Students_0"},{"heading":"The Core Problem: Stopping \"Have You Received My FAFSA?\" Calls","level":3,"id":"The_Core_Problem_Stopping_\"Have_You_Received_My_FAFSA?\"_Calls_0"},{"heading":"Locking High School and GED ISIR Updates","level":2,"id":"Locking_High_School_and_GED_ISIR_Updates_0"},{"heading":"Jonathan's Explanation: Title IV Eligibility and Compliance","level":3,"id":"Jonathan's_Explanation_Title_IV_Eligibility_and_Compliance_0"},{"heading":"The Confusion: Loading vs. Locking","level":3,"id":"The_Confusion_Loading_vs._Locking_0"},{"heading":"Clarifying the Process for Non-Packaged Students","level":3,"id":"Clarifying_the_Process_for_Non-Packaged_Students_0"},{"heading":"Clarifying the Process for Packaged (Locked) Students","level":3,"id":"Clarifying_the_Process_for_Packaged_(Locked)_Students_0"},{"heading":"Resolution and New Procedure","level":3,"id":"Resolution_and_New_Procedure_0"},{"heading":"ISIR Suspense and Tracking Group Process","level":2,"id":"ISIR_Suspense_and_Tracking_Group_Process_0"},{"heading":"The Problem: Records Not Picked Up by Tracking","level":3,"id":"The_Problem_Records_Not_Picked_Up_by_Tracking_0"},{"heading":"Suspense Records vs. Locked Records","level":3,"id":"Suspense_Records_vs._Locked_Records_0"},{"heading":"The \"Load Date\" Issue","level":3,"id":"The_\"Load_Date\"_Issue_0"},{"heading":"What-If: Skipping Processing Days","level":3,"id":"What-If_Skipping_Processing_Days_0"},{"heading":"Proposed Solution for Suspense Processing","level":3,"id":"Proposed_Solution_for_Suspense_Processing_0"},{"heading":"Temporary Instructions","level":3,"id":"Temporary_Instructions_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-07-zoom-fafsa-receipt,-locking-ged-and-hs-updates-transcript.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761226042288,"modifiedTime":1761238237938,"sourceSize":20795,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2025-10-07 - Zoom - FAFSA Receipt, Locking GED and HS Updates - Transcript.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-07-zoom-fafsa-receipt,-locking-ged-and-hs-updates-transcript.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":62,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-16-ba-fa-8.54.1-&-9.3.54.html":{"title":"2025-10-16 - BA FA 8.54.1 & 9.3.54","icon":"","description":"<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://elluciansupport.service-now.com/customer_center?id=standard_ticket_customer_center&amp;table=ellucian_product_release&amp;sys_id=a918b535978b62d0ebc2bdcfe153af69&amp;view=sp\" target=\"_self\">https://elluciansupport.service-now.com/customer_center?id=standard_ticket_customer_center&amp;table=ellucian_product_release&amp;sys_id=a918b535978b62d0ebc2bdcfe153af69&amp;view=sp</a>October Release - This release contains Product Defect (PD) resolutions and Technical Currency updates for Banner Financial AidDependencies:\nBA FIN AID 8.54\nBanner Accounts Receivable 8.17\nBA GENERAL 8.24\nBanner Student 8.35","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/banner/updates"],"headers":[{"heading":"2025-10-16 - BA FA 8.54.1 &amp; 9.3.54","level":1,"id":"2025-10-16_-_BA_FA_8.54.1_&_9.3.54_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-16-ba-fa-8.54.1-&-9.3.54.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757521882714,"modifiedTime":1757522358277,"sourceSize":454,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2025-10-16 - BA FA 8.54.1 & 9.3.54.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-16-ba-fa-8.54.1-&-9.3.54.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":63,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-18-how-handle-isirs-loaded-next-day-jenn.html":{"title":"2025-10-18 - How Handle ISIRs Loaded Next Day - Jenn","icon":"","description":"Reviewed how to handle ISIR’s loaded next day because transaction was lockedI could not determine a great way to pick these records up.

So, once they're verified, we lock those FAFSAs, but we don't lock every packaged student, because then you just end up spending all your time unlocking them and loading the ISIRs that didn't have any SAI changes.When before, the mindset, or the policy that you guys had was, \"We don't load it unless we need to.\" Now the policy is, you load it unless there's a reason not to, so you're loading more than you're not loading, so locking it is just kind of creating a ripple effect of extra work that needs to be done, or taken care of, or followed up with reports. So that may be a discussion that you want to have, is: Do we need to lock all these records for package shoots?Jennifer Buckles:&nbsp;If the... if you decide not to, a consideration is that you would need to have a report that could show you... which... she has this on her needs analysis report that she has, but if the SAI changes from one transaction to the next, and they've already been packaged. Somebody's got to look at those, because if you're just loading them over top, the SAI changes, that could change your eligibility, but typically that wouldn't be a Dawn report, that would be somebody in the packaging area, because that person needs to evaluate their eligibility for all the awards. So it's not necessarily something the ISIR load person is doing, but it's more of a packaging report, that \"We got a new transaction with a new SAI, we need to make sure the student's still eligible for their awards.\"So, it's not a quick, easy decision, because there's give and take with both sides of it, but it may be something you want to discuss if it makes sense to continue locking everyone who's packaged, or should you just follow up on people who have SAI changes after they've been packaged.Kenneth Kirksey:&nbsp;Okay, I'll talk with them, but we may need to just sit down and talk about that.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/isir_processing"],"headers":[{"heading":"Transcript","level":2,"id":"Transcript_0"},{"heading":"Potential Solutions: Reporting vs. Changing Lock Policy","level":3,"id":"Potential_Solutions_Reporting_vs._Changing_Lock_Policy_0"},{"heading":"Consideration for Policy Change","level":3,"id":"Consideration_for_Policy_Change_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-27-why-students-with-cflags-aren't-having-requirements-added-in-rrrareq.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761601625918,"modifiedTime":1761602651618,"sourceSize":2956,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2025-10-27 - Why Students with CFlags aren't having requirements added in RRRAREQ.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-27-why-students-with-cflags-aren't-having-requirements-added-in-rrrareq.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":66,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-10-29-email-dsbrev-no-fafsa.html":{"title":"2025-10-29 - Email - DSBREV no FAFSA","icon":"","description":"From: LeeAnn Barnes\nTo: to Jennifer, me\nDate: Oct 28, 2025, 11:33 AMHey Jenn,I cannot remember.&nbsp; Does the DSBREV process exclude students with no FAFSA?&nbsp; Leslie asked about this student 900995370.&nbsp; They do not have a DSBREV but they are over COA.&nbsp; Institutional scholarships aren't allowed to be over COA.&nbsp; 900995370 D.

If I decide to stick with one of the four remaining letters to indicate a re-review, is there a way to identify them in case they have been reviewed a second time for data purposes to see how many we received in a given academic year? Otherwise, I may decide to set back to an R for two reasons. One reason is either way, I have to review them just to be certain. The second reason is that I don't trust NSLDS necessarily, where the information I have reviewed at the time changes spontaneously, a lot from the consolidation that occurred, where the amounts increase much more than initially reviewed. The deciding factor for the 4 remaining letters is whether it is easy to identify after they have been reviewed or not. If so, then let's do it. If not, let's stick with the R's.<br>From: Jennifer Buckles <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"mailto:jennbucklesconsulting@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"mailto:jennbucklesconsulting@gmail.com\" target=\"_self\">jennbucklesconsulting@gmail.com</a>To: Jonathan, Angie, meDate: Nov 8, 2025, 1:39 PMNo, the process would just be changing the status if the tracking code already exists or adding the tracking code if it doesn’t. So we can either make them the same status to indicate they need review or use one tracking code if the tracking code already exists and another if the tracking code doesn’t exist.So, if you review and change it to a P or and S and another ISIR comes in, it would be set back to R (or whatever code you use for secondary review).<br>From: Jonathan Ibarra <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"mailto:ibarrajr@appstate.edu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"mailto:ibarrajr@appstate.edu\" target=\"_self\">ibarrajr@appstate.edu</a>To: Jennifer, Angie, meDate: Nov 10, 2025, 8:33 AMJen,To avoid confusion, let's stick with the R instead of using the remaining 4 letters.

Disbursement Strategy: Moving from split disbursements to a single disbursement model using \"plus/minus\" day logic to control the release of funds based on student start dates. System Setup (Rorsair &amp; RFRDFA): Configuration of loan periods and fund disbursement rules for the 2026-2027 academic year. Calculation Logic: Deciding between a \"Minus 10 days\" or \"Plus 3 days\" rule for scheduling disbursements relative to class start dates. Who is responsible for setting memo dates? (LeeAnn Barnes) Student Accounts likely drives this date because they need memos removed to process balance payments. (Jennifer Buckles) Do we need two separate disbursement dates for PKH in the system? (Kenneth Kirksey) No. The process has changed to a single disbursement per term (Fall, Spring, Summer). The specific timing for students starting later (Part of Term 2) is handled via \"plus/minus\" date logic rather than manual split disbursements. (Jennifer Buckles) What should be entered as the default disbursement date in Rorsair and RFRDFA? (Kenneth Kirksey) Enter the date of the first disbursement (e.g., 8/20/26). This serves as a placeholder until the student registers; once registered, the system calculates the actual date based on the start of classes. (Jennifer Buckles) Did the team settle on \"Minus 10\" or \"Plus 3\" days for the disbursement calculation? (Kenneth Kirksey) The team agreed on Plus 3 (disbursing 3 days after the start of class). This aligns with Allison's preference and previous meeting notes from October 22nd. (LeeAnn Barnes &amp; Jennifer Buckles) How should RFRDFA be set up for Part of Term 2 (KO2) starts? (Kenneth Kirksey) Do not enter a specific second date. The default date (Part of Term 1 date) will apply initially. When the system detects a KO2 start date (e.g., 10/14), the \"Plus 3\" logic will automatically reschedule the disbursement to the correct date (e.g., 10/17). (Jennifer Buckles) Memo Expiration Date: For the 2026-2027 year, the memo expiration date will be set to the drop/add date of the second part of the term (KO2). This prevents memos from expiring too early for students who start later in the semester. Disbursement Logic: The disbursement calculation rule is officially set to \"Plus 3\" (3 days after the start of classes). Default Date Configuration: In Rorsair and RFRDFA, the hard-coded default disbursement date will match the first disbursement date of the term (e.g., 8/20 for Fall 2026). Single Disbursement Model: The team confirmed they are not returning to a split disbursement model for 2026-2027; they will rely on the system's calculation logic to handle different start dates. Task: Update the Rorsair and RFRDFA configurations for the 2026-2027 aid year to reflect the single disbursement setup with the \"Plus 3\" day calculation rule.

We're doing two different disbursements this year.LeeAnn Barnes: No, they're getting paid—unless they were… I don't know, I'm confusing myself.Jennifer Buckles: Did it change to only one disbursement?LeeAnn Barnes: It's one disbursement.Jennifer Buckles: And that's why we did the plus-minus dates. So that if they start in Part of Term 2, they'll get it scheduled with Part of Term 2. But if they're in one or both, they'll get it all at once.LeeAnn Barnes: Yes.Jennifer Buckles: Okay, so we don't need two disbursement dates anymore. But you do still need a memo date that accommodates that second part of term.LeeAnn Barnes: Yes, that's what I was talking about. When you mentioned the disbursement thing, I was talking about the memo date.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, so let me go back. Let me pull up my Rorsair. Here's what I set up for Rorsair, because my notes said to set it for the KO1 and KO2 disbursements.Jennifer Buckles: From that meeting we had... Okay, Rorsair is your loan periods. This is just for loans.LeeAnn Barnes: And that would be correct, right?Jennifer Buckles: No.LeeAnn Barnes: No.Jennifer Buckles: I don't think you're splitting them anymore. I think you're just doing one fall disbursement, one spring disbursement, and one summer disbursement. You're handling the people who start later with the plus-minus days so that they don't get their stuff early. You were trying to handle that manually by splitting the disbursements, but it caused problems because they get the bill all upfront, then their disbursements are split, and they're not getting their refunds or all their funds. So since you're billing for all upfront, you were just going to pay all at the same time, as long as they had already started classes, which the plus-minus days will control.LeeAnn Barnes: Yes. It's coming back to me now. Thank you.Kenneth Kirksey: So, for Rorsair, what disbursement dates do we need then?Jennifer Buckles: They should match RFRDFA. Do you have RFRDFA set up for PKH?Kenneth Kirksey: No, I was waiting for us to settle on what the memo expiration date needed to be.Jennifer Buckles: I thought we already did this on 25-26, where we changed it to one disbursement for PKH.Kenneth Kirksey: Yes.Jennifer Buckles: Okay, so we definitely will not be going back to two for 26-27.LeeAnn Barnes: Yeah, let's look at 25-26.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, so here's 25-26. And that was the day after the K02 drop/add.LeeAnn Barnes: That's the memo expiration date, so that should be the drop/add date for KO2.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah. So I think that's what you'd want to do, just like that. That way, if they are a KO2 start, they don't lose their memo too early. Because if you use the August date and they're a KO2 start, they won't have their disbursement yet, and their memo goes away for a couple of months, so it looks like they owe the balance.LeeAnn Barnes: Right.Jennifer Buckles: So yeah, I think the 26-27 version of this is what you want to do.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay.LeeAnn Barnes: And then those disbursement dates would be down below.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, so you'd have your August, your January, your May, and then you just have your plus-minus, or your minus 10 dates.Kenneth Kirksey: For the PKH, we did say the minus 10. But you do have to enter a disbursement date.Jennifer Buckles: Yes, it has to have a date. If they're not registered, it can't calculate the minus 10, so that disbursement date there becomes the default. So if a disbursement record gets created before they register, it will date it with that. It's not going to disburse because they're not enrolled, but it has to have a date to create that record on either RAP Award or Reladlor.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, so for PKH RFRDFA 25-26... let me look at Rorsair 25-26. Okay, so our disbursement dates were... see, that's where things are confusing me. We only had a single disbursement date for PKH in fall 2025; it was 8/22. But for 26-27, we have a fall disbursement and then a fall two disbursement.Jennifer Buckles: Right, but that's what the minus 10 is going to do. It's only for the people who are only Part of Term 2, not the people who are in both.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, so how do we...Jennifer Buckles: I think this year you're accomplishing that with ROA holds. You're putting holds on people in Part of Term 2 who are not enrolled. This past fall, what happened was at drop/add or minimum hours, all their aid got canceled because they weren't enrolled. But then we realized they were PKH, and they still could enroll. So the new plan for spring was, at minimum hours, if they're not enrolled but they're PKH, you're not going to cancel them, but you're going to put an ROA hold on them that will expire with the PKH Part of Term 2 disbursement date.Kenneth Kirksey: So, for 26-27, do we just do the same thing in Rorsair, except add the minus 10 for all the terms?Jennifer Buckles: Correct.Kenneth Kirksey: So it'll look like this, with the right disbursement dates. But there are two PKH disbursement dates. The 2025-40…Jennifer Buckles: The first one. You put the first one as the default, and then the minus 10 will adjust the ones that don't fit that one. As long as that first one lines up with minus 10 from the PKH date. That's the other thing I wasn't 100% sure about. That date that's listed there, is that minus 10 from the start date of PKH? No, it's not. It's plus 3.LeeAnn Barnes: I'm lost.Jennifer Buckles: The first day of classes is the 17th. PKH disbursement is the 20th. But we were talking about minus 10, meaning schedule it 10 days before the start of their classes.Kenneth Kirksey: Right.Jennifer Buckles: So you need to clarify which one that is. Do we want them dispersing 10 days before they start or three days after? I do remember a discussion about the three days after.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, and I remember us going back and forth and talking about it.Jennifer Buckles: What day of the week that would be, and all of this, but I don't remember what was settled.LeeAnn Barnes: I can't remember either.Jennifer Buckles: So if this document is the bible here where you need to follow these dates, then you need to use plus 3 instead of minus 10. And the plus 3 would apply for that second one too. Because if they don't start till 10/14, it would automatically schedule them for 10/17. So it's the same for both, which is good. If it's not the same for both, you have to pick a number because it will do the same for both.LeeAnn Barnes: So, go back to that RFRDFA screen or the Rorsair screen. I just want to make sure I understand. Where it says disbursement date, you would put the first day of the class, and then put minus...?Jennifer Buckles: No, you would put the first disbursement date.LeeAnn Barnes: Okay.Jennifer Buckles: So that date is only used when they're not enrolled because it has to have a date. It's a placeholder. Then, once they're enrolled, it will automatically add or minus the days from their first start of class.LeeAnn Barnes: Okay, that makes sense.Jennifer Buckles: So if you put 8/22 there, and then you're telling it plus 3, it would schedule everybody to 8/22 until they register. When they register and start classes on 8/17, it'll add 3 and reschedule to that new date. Normally, I like to make the first date match that first disbursement. So if I'm going to be doing 8/20, I would put 8/20 in as the default date and then plus 3 for my calculation. That way, the majority of students don't even need to be rescheduled. Their default date will be the correct date. It's just the ones that are KO2 starts that will need to be rescheduled. If you do a random date and everybody has to be rescheduled, I feel like that's just more chances that something doesn't get rescheduled in time or gets dispersed on the wrong date.LeeAnn Barnes: Makes sense.Kenneth Kirksey: So, question is, did we land on minus 10 or plus 3? Let me see.Jennifer Buckles: Do you have the transcript from that meeting?LeeAnn Barnes: I don't remember.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, this one says minus 10, and that was on September 30th.Jennifer Buckles: Who creates that calendar document that you have with all those dates on it?LeeAnn Barnes: It's based on the academic calendar that's posted by student accounts. It's on the website.Jennifer Buckles: So that PKH disbursement date is public?LeeAnn Barnes: No, that's not on there. Our office comes up with the disbursement date.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, now here's the meeting from October 22nd, and it says plus 3.Jennifer Buckles: Who's going to make the call?LeeAnn Barnes: I'm thinking it's the plus 3. I think that's what it should be. I think that's an Allison call, for sure, but I'm pretty positive that's the way she wanted it set up from the get-go.Kenneth Kirksey: And then Jen, you said it's a good practice to make the hard-coded disbursement date the same as that plus 3 date.Jennifer Buckles: For the first disbursement, yes. So for 26-27, I believe that was 8/20. So 8/20 would be your date, and then plus 3. Classes start on the 17th, so it should schedule everybody to the 20th.Kenneth Kirksey: So for Rorsair, our first day of class fall disbursement is 8/20, so yeah, that's the plus 3. What would our KO2 disbursement date be?Jennifer Buckles: You don't put one in Rorsair.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay.Jennifer Buckles: So your KO2 people, until they register, their disbursements are going to be scheduled for 8/20 because it's going to use that default date. As soon as they register and Banner sees their first start date is 10/14, it will then reschedule their disbursements to 10/17.Kenneth Kirksey: I got it. So, same thing in RFRDFA?Jennifer Buckles: Correct.Kenneth Kirksey: We only put the disbursement date for the first one. And then once they register, it will see they started on the 14th, so we'll disperse on the 17th.Jennifer Buckles: Correct. But that should be 2026, right? Not 27.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah. Okay. I think I've got it now. This is not complicated at all.LeeAnn Barnes: They don't spell it out anywhere, really.Kenneth Kirksey: PKH is the bane of my existence.LeeAnn Barnes: Yeah, I think it's the bane of all of us.Kenneth Kirksey: I'm not sure which is worse, though, PKH or Summer.Jennifer Buckles: I'd take PKH over summer any day, especially the way you guys do summer.LeeAnn Barnes: Yes.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, well... Oh, I found out—LeeAnn and I were sitting here watching the deer today, and I found out why I have deer come up here behind my office so much. There's either a guy or a lady in this house right behind my office that is bringing them corn and spreading it out on the driveway. There were like three deer up there, and I saw this person walking toward them, and they didn't run away.LeeAnn Barnes: That's funny.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, well, thank y'all very much. I will fix this. This isn't going to happen today, so I'll just have to run it tomorrow sometime.Jennifer Buckles: Yep.LeeAnn Barnes: Alright.Kenneth Kirksey: Alright, thank you, y'all.LeeAnn Barnes: Alright, bye.Kenneth Kirksey: See you later.

Process Automation: The proposal to run the grouping process in production to automate the assignment of groups, removing the need for manual entry by staff member Lindley. Sequence of Operations: Defining the correct order of processing: Grouping FASH (Scholarships) Estimated Packaging. Budget &amp; Rules: Status of freshman budget amounts and rules; rules are built but awaiting final amounts before moving to production. SI Test Environment Timeline: Coordinating a timeline to complete these tasks in production today so they reflect in the SI Test environment after the 6:00 PM refresh. What is left to do on the estimated awards? (Kenneth Kirksey) There is one last test required. The team wanted to wait for institutional scholarships to be awarded, but a grouping issue within FASH needs to be resolved first. (Jonathan Ibarra / Wendy Ray) Can the team run groups so Lindley does not have to manually add them when running FASH? (Wendy Ray) Yes, Kenneth can enable this process, but he must first double-check the setup checklist to ensure everything is ready. (Kenneth Kirksey) Do students have to be able to see their scholarships in the portal? (Jennifer Buckles) No, they do not need to see them in the portal. They will see their terms and conditions in Slate; it is not connected to the estimated package at this time. (Wendy Ray) Is there any reason not to run the group assignments now? (Kenneth Kirksey) No, provided the checklist is completed and there are no outstanding setup items. (Jennifer Buckles) Will running estimated packaging over top of scholarships change the amounts? (Kenneth Kirksey) Yes, potentially. A student's need may change if they have a scholarship, which is why scholarships should be added before running estimated packaging to avoid working overbudgets. (Jennifer Buckles) What is the cutoff time for data in production to reflect on the SI test environment? (Jonathan Ibarra) 6:00 PM. (Kenneth Kirksey) Run Grouping in Production: The team agreed to run the grouping process in production immediately to facilitate the mass upload of scholarships via FASH without manual entry. Operational Sequence: The team established the order of operations: 1) Run Grouping, 2) Run FASH (Scholarships), 3) Run Estimated Packaging. Freshman Budget Rules: The rule for new freshman amounts is built but will remain out of production until the final budget amount is confirmed. Standard Group Chain: The \"Standard Group\" process must be run as a separate chain from the ISIR load to prevent system failures if the population selection pulls zero records. Task: Review the setup checklist and ensure all award posts in Banner have the correct periods. [Owner: Kenneth Kirksey, Deadline: Today] Task: Enable and run the Grouping process (including the separate Standard Group chain) in production. [Owner: Kenneth Kirksey, Deadline: Today, prior to 5:30 PM] Task: Run FASH to mass upload over 7,000 scholarships once grouping is confirmed. [Owner: Wendy Ray/Lindley, Deadline: Today, before the 6:00 PM SI cutoff] Task: Notify Wendy Ray when the grouping process is complete.

Disabled Processes: Several downstream processes are currently disabled or have not yet been run for the 26-27 aid year, including: Fixate periods. Fixed year in college. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Data loads. Packaging Group Assignments. Scholarship Management (FASH): The institutional scholarship process involves mass uploading awards (over 7,000 records) or using the Banner portal. This process relies on the underlying Banner \"Packaging Group\" to function efficiently. Budgeting: Budgets are mostly finalized, with the exception of the final freshman amount. However, the system allows for budgeting to update continuously until a package is locked. The most critical immediate issue is a workflow inefficiency regarding the FASH (Fund Awarding Scholarship) process.\nThe Issue: FASH relies on students having an assigned \"Packaging Group\" in Banner to post awards automatically. Because the \"Grouping\" process has not been run for the 26-27 aid year, students currently have no group assigned. The Consequence: If the mass upload of 7,000+ scholarships is attempted without existing groups, the Financial Aid staff (specifically Lindley) would be forced to manually add a packaging group to every single student record. This is a significant waste of time and introduces high potential for human error. The Issue: There is a risk of inefficient workflow if \"Estimated Packaging\" is run before institutional scholarships are posted. The Consequence: If a student is packaged with need-based aid first, and then a scholarship is added later, the student may become \"over-budget\" or \"over-awarded.\" This requires staff to manually \"work overbudgets\" to reduce other aid. The Issue: The \"Standard Group\" process (for students without a FAFSA) was previously part of the main ISIR load chain. The Risk: If the population selection (pop sel) for this group pulls zero records, it causes the entire ISIR load chain to fail and abort. To resolve the manual processing bottleneck and ensure accurate packaging, the team agreed to the following solutions:The technical team will run the Grouping process for all 26-27 students before the scholarship upload occurs. This includes both:\nISIR Groups: Students with a valid FAFSA. Standard Groups: Students without a FAFSA (assigned a generic group). Outcome: This ensures that when FASH is run, the system recognizes the students' groups and posts awards automatically, eliminating the need for Lindley to manually touch 7,000 records. The workflow will be strictly sequenced to minimize rework:\nGroup Assignment: Run grouping for all students.\nFASH Upload: Post institutional scholarships.\nEstimated Packaging: Run packaging after scholarships are on the record. Outcome: The packaging engine will \"see\" the scholarship as an existing resource and calculate remaining need/eligibility correctly the first time, preventing over-award situations. The \"Standard Group\" process has been isolated into its own execution chain. It is no longer dependent on the ISIR load chain. This mitigates the risk of the main data load failing if no students qualify for the standard group on a specific day.\nValidation Report: After running groups, a validation check is required to ensure both FAFSA and Non-FAFSA students have a group assigned. Budget Rules: Ensure the \"New Freshman\" budget rule is built (completed by Jennifer), even if the final dollar amount is pending. Banner Financial Aid: Ensure all Award periods are correct on the award forms. Verify DISBRV (Disbursement Review) is not running for 26-27 yet to prevent interference. AppWorx / Job Scheduling: Standard Group Chain: Must be configured as a standalone chain separate from the ISIR load. Daily Schedule: Enable the Grouping process to run daily moving forward. For the Technical Lead (Kenneth): Pre-Flight Checklist: Review the 26-27 Setup Checklist to ensure no outstanding configuration items remain (other than the known budget variance). Configure Grouping Dates: Access the Grouping process parameters. Set the dates to look retroactively to the beginning of the cycle to catch all students loaded up to this point. Execute Grouping Chains: Step A: Run the ISIR Grouping process (for FAFSA students). Step B: Run the Standard Grouping chain (for non-FAFSA students). Enable Daily Schedule: Update the scheduler to ensure these grouping processes run automatically every night. Notify Business Unit: Inform Wendy/Lindley immediately upon completion (Target: Before 5:30 PM). For the Financial Aid Team (Wendy/Lindley): Validation: Once notified by Kenneth, check two specific test cases: One student with a FAFSA (confirm AES award adds correctly). One student without a FAFSA (confirm AES award adds correctly). Execute FASH Upload: Proceed with the mass upload of the 7,000+ scholarship records. Deadline: This must be completed at least 30 minutes prior to the 6:00 PM SI Test environment refresh.

We wanted to wait until we got some of the institutional scholarships awarded, but Wendy came across an issue, so I'll let her talk a little bit about that.Wendy Ray: So, using the Banner portal and/or mass uploading those means that Lindley has to run FASH. With the new process, she has to manually add grouping to every single student. So, we have over 7,000 scholarships we're getting ready to offer. She's going to have to run FASH on them. If they don't have a group, she's going to have to manually add it.Jennifer Buckles: Why don't you wait until we do the grouping? Because you haven't run grouping at all for 26-27. We have it set up so that even if they don't have a FAFSA, they'll get a standard group.Jonathan Ibarra: I could have sworn that was included in the review of the test that we've been looking at during SI tests. But I'm assuming you mean in production, you haven't really done any grouping in production.Jennifer Buckles: I believe they're just loading ISIRs and not running groups at all.Kenneth Kirksey: No.Wendy Ray: So can we run groups so that Lindley doesn't have to manually do that when she runs FASH? Or does that mean they're packaged?Jonathan Ibarra: No.Wendy Ray: Okay, two different things.Jonathan Ibarra: Jen, how soon can we do that?Jennifer Buckles: While he's looking at that, do your students have to be able to see their scholarships in the portal?Wendy Ray: We don't want them to see them.Jennifer Buckles: Okay, good. Because if we put them in this estimate freshman packaging group, it's a visible to them. I just wanted to make sure you weren't directing them, \"Hey, go out here and accept your scholarship,\" and they go in there and they can't see it.Wendy Ray: No. They will be able to see their terms and conditions in Slate. It's not connected to their estimated package at all right now.Kenneth Kirksey: Why does FASH depend on grouping?Wendy Ray: That was the new process that you worked with Lindley and the pop sels, and all of that.Kenneth Kirksey: Oh, okay, yeah, I remember. It's been a minute.Jennifer Buckles: I do think we need to run a test of running the estimated packaging on top of awards that are posted through FASH. I know that if you batch post in Banner, or if you manually add an award in Banner, running packaging on top of that won't touch it. I'm assuming it won't with FASH as well, but we didn't test that. You guys do that all the time; you run through FASH and then package on top of it all the time, so I'm not too concerned about it being a problem. It would just make me feel better to know we ran a full simulation of what it was going to be like.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, so what we have been running, let me zoom in a little bit. We've just been running the RTP, RCPTP. We have not been running fixate periods, fixed year in college, SAP, or data load.Kenneth Kirksey: Jen, is there any reason for us not to run the group assignments?Jennifer Buckles: Not that I know of. Have you completely finished the checklist? Like, there's no outstanding setup items that need to be done?Kenneth Kirksey: Let me go back and double-check.Jennifer Buckles: I think we were waiting on—part of the delay was budgets. We were waiting for more finalized budget numbers. I know Leanne has updated everything that she can at this point. The couple of outstanding things for the budgets are the new freshman amount, what that's going to be. I've got the rule built, but I didn't want to put it in production until we knew the amount because it just didn't jibe with what was already in there for the other people that are not freshmen. So I just wanted confirmation on that.But if we went ahead and awarded budgets now, they'll continuously get updated until they're packaged. That's not a deal-breaker where we need to wait for that. Until they get packaged, they'll keep getting their budget amounts. But for these freshmen, they're going to get a package date when we do the estimated packaging, so they won't get re-budgeted until we change them from their estimate to the real package. Then they'll get an updated budget.Kenneth Kirksey: I can enable this, and I know on the first run, I'll have to go back and set the dates so it picks up everybody we've done to this point. But I can go ahead and do that, and then we'll just enable this so it'll be running daily.Jennifer Buckles: You'll want to make sure this is probably part of your checklist, but that all your award posts in Banner have the new, the right periods on them from the rule. The only other note I would have on this grouping is the standard group. We pulled that out into a separate chain. I ran it once while you were out for 25-26. That's the one where if the pop sel pulls zero and then the groups run, it fails and aborts the whole chain. So we wanted that separate from the ISIR load chain so it wouldn't cause problems. It's now that separate chain. So running this would take care of the people who have FAFSAs, but then you would also need to run that standard chain to get everybody in a standard group.Kenneth Kirksey: Right. Okay. I will go ahead and check the checklist to make sure we've got everything set up, and then run groups. After I run groups, we'll double-check to make sure everybody's grouped, and then Lindley can run FASH.Wendy Ray: Yeah, if you can just let me know when groups are done, then I will get some... I have two AES awards added because one has a FAFSA and one does not. We just wanted to double-check that before I did the mass upload, because the mass upload is over 7,000.Kenneth Kirksey: And then once we do scholarships, we'll do the estimated packaging over top of that. So that will take into account... will that change the amounts?Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, potentially. Their need could be changed if they now have a scholarship, so they may not be as eligible for the same sub or whatever.Wendy Ray: I think that was the whole thought process—is adding scholarships before we ran estimated so that we did not have to process and work overbudgets.Jennifer Buckles: I would also say I wouldn't waste time working overbudgets on estimated packages because they're going to all get redone anyway. But I don't know if we have DISBRV running. It will probably pick it up, but it won't recognize it as an estimated package unless we put something in there. I don't know if DISBRV is running for 26-27 yet.Kenneth Kirksey: No.Jonathan Ibarra: So what's the timeline on this?Kenneth Kirksey: I would say I probably need today to double-check and make sure we've done everything in the checklist. Then I'd go ahead and run all of this this evening, so we could have it in the SI test.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, but we wouldn't do that, ideally, until some scholarship awards had been pushed. So it's kind of like, we need this grouping to run so that then you can run the FASH to push the scholarships, because then they'll be grouped and you don't have to do manual grouping. Then we can run the packaging test. We just need that sequence to happen.Jonathan Ibarra: Kenneth, what is the cutoff time for anything to reflect on SI test from production?Kenneth Kirksey: 6 p.m.Wendy Ray: Okay. As long as you could give us 30 minutes to get the FASH run, I think we would be okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Can do.Jonathan Ibarra: Sounds good.Kenneth Kirksey: All right, well, I have my assignment for today.Wendy Ray: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: All right, thank you.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/awards/estimated"],"headers":[{"heading":"Estimated Awards Process and FASH Grouping Issue","level":1,"id":"Estimated_Awards_Process_and_FASH_Grouping_Issue_0"},{"heading":"Introduction &amp; Technical Issues","level":2,"id":"Introduction_&_Technical_Issues_0"},{"heading":"Estimated Awards: FASH Grouping Issue","level":2,"id":"Estimated_Awards_FASH_Grouping_Issue_0"},{"heading":"Problem Identification","level":3,"id":"Problem_Identification_0"},{"heading":"Proposed Solution: Pre-run Grouping","level":3,"id":"Proposed_Solution_Pre-run_Grouping_0"},{"heading":"Clarifying the Process","level":3,"id":"Clarifying_the_Process_0"},{"heading":"Testing and Workflow Sequence","level":2,"id":"Testing_and_Workflow_Sequence_0"},{"heading":"Required Testing","level":3,"id":"Required_Testing_0"},{"heading":"Current and Required Processes","level":3,"id":"Current_and_Required_Processes_0"},{"heading":"Budget Finalization Status","level":3,"id":"Budget_Finalization_Status_0"},{"heading":"Action Plan and Timeline","level":2,"id":"Action_Plan_and_Timeline_0"},{"heading":"Step-by-Step Plan","level":3,"id":"Step-by-Step_Plan_0"},{"heading":"Timeline for SI Test Environment","level":3,"id":"Timeline_for_SI_Test_Environment_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-12-09-zoom-transcript-estimated-awards.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1765307025527,"modifiedTime":1765821005514,"sourceSize":8783,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2025-12-09 - Zoom Transcript - Estimated Awards.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-12-09-zoom-transcript-estimated-awards.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":81,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2025-12-19-sap-notes-for-spring-2026-leeann-barnes.html":{"title":"2025-12-19 - SAP Notes for Spring 2026 - LeeAnn Barnes","icon":"","description":"Just wanted to give you an update on SAP for spring and remind you of how things will look.&nbsp; If you have any questions&nbsp;please let me know. SAP appeals have been added to students who were on an approved appeal/probationary term for fall 2025 (AAF) but failed to earn at least 75% of all attempted hours.&nbsp; There were 95 students who failed to meet these requirements. Below is what you will now see for these students: RRAAREQ - SAP \"R\" as of 12/18/25 ROASTAT - Eligibility status tab will have 202610 with one of the following status':&nbsp; MAU, MAG, D150 STUDENT FORMS - the student will have a SAP appeal requirement and the tracking status of that appeal will be&nbsp;\"SAP 2\".&nbsp; This means the student was approved&nbsp; but failed and now needs to appeal again for a subsequent term for the aid year. What do these students need to provide for their appeal? Regardless of their SAP status of MAU, MAG or D150 - these&nbsp;students need to explain the reasons why they did not earn 75% for fall and must provide documentation that supports those reasons.&nbsp; If they are D150, they will need to provide more than an academic plan or copy of degreeworks.&nbsp; &nbsp;They already provided that for their previous appeal.&nbsp; This time they are appealing for not meeting the probationary requirements. What if a F grade or an incomplete grade gets updated to a passing grade? If a student says they had a F grade or an incomplete update to a passing grade, then let me know and we will review to see if their status should change and if they still need to appeal. Students on an AAF status for fall who were not enrolled remain eligible for spring term and their status will be updated to AAS in ROASTAT. Students on an AAF status for fall and earned at least 75%, BUT are not meeting OVERALL SAP standards will remain eligible for spring and their status will be updated to AAS in ROASTAT. Students on an AAF status for fall and earned at least 75%, AND are meeting OVERALL SAP standards will remain eligible for spring and their status will be updated to AU or AG in ROASTAT. Students on NEW, AU or AG for fall, regardless of their fall grades (even if they failed everything), their status will remain the same.&nbsp; No new status will be added to ROASTAT.&nbsp; We do not evaluate these students until the ANNUAL process at the end of spring term. Students on MAU or MAG who were enrolled in Fall; regardless if their fall grades improve their overall SAP status, their SAP will not be evaluated again until the ANNUAL process at the end of spring term so if they want to be considered for spring eligibility, they may appeal. Students on D150 will also need to to appeal for to be considered for spring eligibility.

Scholarship Universe is plugging right along. We are discussing review set up with Lauren now and beginning the process of structuring committees in-system. I am combining SU resources with our internal review processes for committee reference. We will be working on the award report that brings scholarship award information from SU into Banner. We've emphasized our need to start this sooner rather than later so that any IT jobs that need Tena's team's assistance can be scheduled accordingly.We briefly reviewed the award report this week, and I feel confident that a script can be written to manage the status of thank-you note requirements in RRAAREQ. We are beginning admin training sessions with college scholarship managers next week. I will be a part of training and documentation this year with the goal of the Scholarship Office managing that aspect in future cycles.Ellucian has resolved the matching problem (🙌) that was causing all questions to be shown to all students regardless of major. They had made an update to the way their system managed SIS data earlier in the year and did not catch this glitch until we brought it up to them. Happy to have that behind us as we move into the spring term.I spoke with a student this week who had difficulty completing her application due to SU compatibility with screen readers. I've escalated the inquiry to Lauren's team and spoken with ODR about any other accessibility issues. I have documentation (attached) from Ellucian confirming the accessibility features of the platform if we ever need it. The student is scheduling time with a FA counselor and I'll be on call to assist as needed with that meeting.Additional announcements via email and social media will go out to students next week when they return for classes. We are a little bit behind last year's numbers (983 vs 1076) but we will monitor as students return and look at utilizing SU's communication features to target populations that have yet to apply.

So to the DSBREV process they look like they’ve had an award change every day. For students who aren’t packaged but are being flagged as DSBREV, you can uncheck the award letter flag on RPAAWRD after review. If there is a real award change the award flag will be re-triggered and they will be marked as DSBREV again.From: LeeAnn Barnes\nTo: Jennifer, me\nDate: Fri, Jan 16, 1:21 PMThank you so much!

Scholarship administrators are receiving training this coming week.Committee spreadsheets went out to each college so we can begin creating the groups in PROD. There are a few key differences in the Blackbaud and SU processes. I'm creating an institutional guide to go with the videos provided by SU. I anticipate sending this guide out to faculty committees late next week. We don't have the bandwidth to host departmental trainings for each committee this year, but we will have multiple ways of providing support throughout the review process!I updated each college on application statuses this week and began sending targeted communications to students in specific departments if they have scholarships with fewer than 5 matches. 4,201 students from CAS and CFAA received these emails today. We get immediate feedback from these emails (See example below).

I know it's a lot and I appreciate how detailed you are. Wondering if there is an M: drive folder where the documentation from Ellucian and your training guides etc live? We keep things in many places and I want to be sure, especially when this is wrapped up for this cycle, that the record keeping is in our permanent place of record on M rather than a google drive with selective access.Not something to deal with now, but something I want to be sure we take care of before you head out on maternity leave (have you decided on a name yet??!!!).\nThanks again, Lindley.\nAlisonFrom: Lindley Davis\nTo: Alison, me, Wendy\nDate: Jan 28, 12:52 PMThank you! That means a lot. It's a lot but I love this kind of work. Never boring!At the moment, most resources I've created are on the Scholarships Office Google Drive so college administrators can access the information they need. I am in the process of creating an institutional user guide that covers the student experience, reviewer role, and awarding steps (16 pages in so far...) I can copy all of these materials over to the M: drive so they are accessible to the rest of the office!The Ellucian materials live in the Customer Center but I have been downloading relevant articles and linking them in the user guide. I can download their full guide and add it to the M: drive for anyone who does not have Customer Center access. All emails from Lauren have been saved and once we get through this cycle, my plan is to go back through those, organize, and add to our internal documentation. Currently, we are jumping from implementation meetings to system setup to administrator training so quickly that there hasn't been downtime to give these the attention they deserve. If you'd like me to prioritize this sooner rather than later, just let me know and I'll make sure it happens.So far the frontrunner is Darcy...the jury is still out on a middle name.

If you have any questions about the below, I can put you in touch with our main IT support person. Thanks!HeidiA while back we posted our code and overview to Banner communities in the Community Code Sharing form. As a Banner school you should have access to it. It’s not a very user-friendly interface, so I’ve posted the high-level description in this email. However, if you want to see the code, you’ll need to get that from the forum. The thread is titled \"Private loan process using files from ELM done at Purdue”.Below is a description of our process-to-process private loans and attached are packages, table definitions and general packages used in Purdue written processes. We use UC4 to automate the process.\nPrivate loan process using files from ELM:\nUse UC4 to pull the files from ELM around 7:30am each workday. Some of the files are just reports used by Financial Aid and/or Bursar. The files that we will load to Banner are .SP2, .SUP and .DS2\nCertification requests (.SP2 files from ELM) are loaded to a Purdue created table (RZTPRLC) with a few additional fields determined, such as aid year. This step is done in one of our budget jobs as we want these students to be added to the popsel to be assigned a financial aid budget in Banner (since many are non-FAFSA filers).\nIn order to know the Banner fund tied to the lender requested we have created a lender table, RZTPLL. Although most of this data is in Banner there were a few pieces of information that we are expected to check that don’t exist in Banner.\nRun RZKBDGT - Load requests from ELM to Purdue Created table.\nRun RBRPBGP - Create budget if student doesn't already have one.\nRun RZKPRLC – Purdue created process to create the award in Banner on RPRAWRD/RPRATRM. We have many checks in this process, so awards are only created if the student meets certain conditions.\nRun RPRELAP (Banner process) to create electronic loan application record on RPRLAPP/RPAELAP\nRun RZKPRLD – Purdue created process as there are a few fields needed on RPRLAPP that aren’t populated when RPRELAP runs\nRun RZKPLLE - Purdue created process to keep loans from extracting that need a manual review. This process will create a popsel of all the loans we want to be extracted\nRun RPRELAX (Banner process), using the popsel created from the prior step, to extract the loans (creates ELAPyyIN_####.DAT)\nRun RPRHDRL (Banner process) to extract loan release file (creates HDRL_####.DAT)\nRun RPRELCT (Banner process) to extract loan correction file (creates ELCTyyIN.DAT)\nRun RPRLNAG (Banner process) to create the aging report of non-disbursed loans\nRun RPRELRU (Banner process) to load the SUP files from ELM\nRun RPREFTL (Banner process) to load DS2, DSB, RST or EFT files (we normally receive DS2 files from ELM)\nSend files to ELM using UC4 process: ELAPyyIN, HDRL, ELCTyyIN\nThat’s the end of our automated process. However, there are a couple of manual steps to complete the EFT processing. The Bursar office has to confirm the payment on RPAEPMT and then RPREFTP is manually ran to post the money to the student record.\nWould you like me to convert any other email chains or summarize the technical steps listed here into an Obsidian task list?","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/awards/loans/elm"],"headers":[{"heading":"Fwd: [External] [cosuaa-members] Banner process for private loans from Purdue","level":2,"id":"Fwd_[External]_[cosuaa-members]_Banner_process_for_private_loans_from_Purdue_0"}],"links":["mailto:carlh@purdue.edu","mailto:cosuaa-members@listserv.unc.edu","mailto:cosuaa-members@listserv.unc.edu"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-26-how-purdue-automated-elm-private-loan-processes.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769967156292,"modifiedTime":1769979314395,"sourceSize":4169,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2026-01-26 - How Purdue Automated ELM Private Loan Processes.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-26-how-purdue-automated-elm-private-loan-processes.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":88,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-27-duplicate-isir-processing-how-to-meeting-ai-generated-checklist.html":{"title":"2026-01-27 - Duplicate ISIR Processing How To Meeting - AI Generated Checklist","icon":"","description":"Based on the transcript provided, here is the step-by-step checklist for processing duplicate ISIR files in Banner Financial Aid.Before starting manual reviews, perform a \"clean slate\" operation to remove historical backlog.\nRun Custom Deletion Job: Execute the custom system job to automatically delete older ISIR transactions and keep only the latest one.\nNote: This clears the \"Duplicate\" status and moves the remaining record to either \"Hold\" or \"Suspense\" for standard processing.\nUse this process for daily maintenance or when reviewing records that remain after the automated job. Identify Duplicate Records: In the Banner ISIR matching form, look at the record count on the right (e.g., \"Record 1 of 2\"). If the ID remains the same when arrowing down but the transaction changes, it is a duplicate. Perform Duplicate Check: * [ ] \"Block down\" twice. Click OK on the duplicate check. Evaluate Transactions: Arrow down to view the different transaction numbers for the student. Check for a valid SAI (Student Aid Index) or other critical data elements. Determine Match Status: If a Match Exists: Select the correct Banner ID and Save. If No Match Exists: Enter \"No Match\" in the designated field (second street line) to indicate the record has been reviewed. Delete Older Transactions (Optional/Manual): To keep the list manageable, identify the older/less desirable transaction. Navigate to that specific record and use the Delete function in the top right. Save the changes. Note: The remaining single transaction will now be picked up by the standard nightly match process. To ensure data integrity and automated tracking, follow these strict guidelines regarding the Load button.\nGeneral Rule: Do NOT click the \"Load\" button. * Individual loading bypasses the nightly batch processes that track C-flags, comment codes, and tracking groups.\nException Handling (Designated Personnel Only):\nOnly the designated lead (e.g., Jonathan) should use the Load button for urgent cases.\nManual Follow-up Required: If a manual load is performed, the user MUST manually:\nRun the Tracking Group process.\nAdd any necessary tracking codes for comment codes.\nWould you like me to draft a brief summary of the \"Load\" button risks to share with the rest of the financial aid staff?","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/isir_processing"],"headers":[{"heading":"📋 Checklist: Processing Duplicate ISIRs in Banner","level":2,"id":"📋_Checklist_Processing_Duplicate_ISIRs_in_Banner_0"},{"heading":"Phase 1: Initial System Cleanup (One-Time / Periodic)","level":3,"id":"Phase_1_Initial_System_Cleanup_(One-Time_/_Periodic)_0"},{"heading":"Phase 2: Manual Review Workflow","level":3,"id":"Phase_2_Manual_Review_Workflow_0"},{"heading":"Phase 3: The \"No Load\" Policy","level":3,"id":"Phase_3_The_\"No_Load\"_Policy_0"},{"heading":"💡 Key Definitions for the Team","level":2,"id":"💡_Key_Definitions_for_the_Team_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-27-duplicate-isir-processing-how-to-meeting-ai-generated-checklist.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769974864409,"modifiedTime":1769976065961,"sourceSize":3248,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2026-01-27 - Duplicate ISIR Processing How To Meeting - AI Generated Checklist.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-27-duplicate-isir-processing-how-to-meeting-ai-generated-checklist.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":89,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-27-duplicate-isir-processing-how-to-meeting-summary.html":{"title":"2026-01-27 - Duplicate ISIR Processing How To Meeting - Summary","icon":"","description":"\nSheila Burleson\nJennifer Buckles\nKenneth Kirksey\nJonathan Ibarra\nAngie Daugherty\nKim (referenced as participant/attendee) Duplicate ISIR Navigation: Understanding how to toggle through multiple records for a single student in the Banner system and interpreting the transaction numbers.\nClearing Backlogs: Strategies for managing the current volume of 270 duplicate records (and over 1,000 for the 26-27 cycle) to prevent staff from reviewing the same non-matching records repeatedly.\nManual vs. Automated Deletion: The pros and cons of running a custom job to delete old ISIR transactions versus manually deleting records during the review process.\nSystem Statuses (Hold vs. Suspense): Clarification on how the system handles records with no matches (Hold) versus potential matches (Suspense).\nThe \"Load\" Button Risks: A technical discussion on why using the manual \"Load\" button is dangerous due to the potential for missing automated tracking, C-flags, and comment code updates.\nBudgeting Discrepancies: Addressing why some students were showing out-of-state tuition rates despite being classified as in-state residents. When I arrow down, the ID number changes but the person doesn't. Does that mean there are two records for that person? Jennifer Buckles confirmed this is correct; they are in \"duplicate\" status. Sheila was seeing record 2 of 2 for a single individual. Is there a possibility that there would be more than two records? Jennifer Buckles confirmed that it is possible to have more than two records if multiple transactions have been submitted. Do we need to look at the transaction number for any reason? Jennifer Buckles explained that transaction numbers are only relevant when deciding which record to delete; generally, the latest transaction is kept. What is the most efficient way to keep the team from looking at duplicate ISIRs every day? Jennifer Buckles suggested deleting the older duplicates. Once only one transaction remains, the record moves out of the duplicate category and into hold or suspense, clearing it from the daily review list. How is the custom job set up to know which record to keep? Jennifer Buckles, Kenneth Kirksey, and Jonathan Ibarra confirmed the job is configured to keep only the latest transaction. What happens to records in \"Hold\" at the end of the year? Jennifer Buckles noted that records typically just sit in the temp table and are not purged, though some schools choose to purge them. Should we use the \"Load\" button as described in the instructions? Jennifer Buckles advised against it. Loading manually bypasses the automated nightly process that stamps records for tracking C-flags and comment codes. If the nightly process doesn't run, those tracking elements are missed. Why did in-state students show out-of-state tuition rates in December? Jennifer Buckles and Kenneth Kirksey concluded it was a timing issue; the budget was added while they were out-of-state, and they were changed to in-state afterward without a budget refresh. Cleanup Strategy: The team will run a one-time custom job to \"clean the slate\" by deleting all but the latest transactions for the current backlog.\nOngoing Maintenance: Moving forward, staff will manually delete older transactions during their daily review to prevent records from staying in the duplicate list.\n\"Load\" Button Restriction: The \"Load\" button will not be used by general staff. Its use is restricted to \"special circumstances\" only.\nAuthorized \"Load\" User: Jonathan Ibarra was designated as the person authorized to make the call on using the manual load button, with the understanding that he must then manually verify tracking and comment codes.\nRecord Preservation: The team decided to stick with the \"keep the latest transaction\" rule for students not yet admitted, as the effort to granularly review transactions for non-applicants is not worth the brainpower.

We block down twice. We do a duplicate check, and there isn't anything. So we hit OK. And then the instruction says, arrow down on your keypad once, and here's one of my questions. When I arrow down, that ID number changes, but the person doesn't. Does that mean that there are two records for that person?Jennifer Buckles: Right, that's why they're in duplicate. If you see over on the right, where it says record 2 of 270, those are the two. Okay. If you arrow back up, you'll go back up to the first one.Sheila Burleson: Okay, so that's what I was doing. I was going down-down to get to the next person, because all of them are like that, or they all should be like that.Jennifer Buckles: Correct.Sheila Burleson: Is there a possibility that there would be more than two?Jennifer Buckles: Yes.Sheila Burleson: Okay, and transaction number, we just ignore that, we don't need to look at that for any reason, honestly.Jennifer Buckles: Right.Sheila Burleson: Okay. And that was kind of hanging us up a little bit, too. We're like, what is that?Jennifer Buckles: The only time you would look at transaction number is when you're trying to decide which one you want to delete. So if you're keeping them for now, because that's the way that the process is set up, you try to match. If there's nothing you can match, they kind of stay hanging out in limbo for as long as you want to leave them out there. Periodically, however often you want to do it, you either run that custom job that deletes the older transaction and keeps the newer one, and then it'll roll into suspense, or into, I guess, either into suspense or into hold, if they're not admitted yet.And then, or, you go in manually and you say, okay, we've got a transaction 4 and a transaction 5. Transaction 4 doesn't have a… you know, if you want to get into granular detail, you can look at the actual transactions and decide, well, 4 has a valid SAI, but 5 doesn't. Let's get rid of 5 and keep 4. So you can make that call.Sheila Burleson: So the transaction number is the number of ISIRs that they have submitted with whatever information is on it. Some of them may be valid in terms of having all the elements we want, some of them wouldn't, and we could get rid of those, but we would still not have a match for the person until we get a match for the person.Jennifer Buckles: Right. So that means this one has 5 transactions, but no match in your system. So that either means they're in suspense. So, they already have an ISIR that's been in suspense, and every time they do a new transaction, it goes into duplicate, you review, delete one, keep the other one, and that cycle just keeps happening, or they just added your school on their fourth or fifth transaction.Sheila Burleson: Got it. Okay. So, as we are popping down here, there could be more than two records for the same person.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, so if you were to arrow down the second time and see the same person again, then you just arrow down. Yeah, so now we got onto a new one. And you can see over there on the right what record you're on.Sheila Burleson: We're on record 3. Okay. And which goes in the sequence of what? So we know we have 270 records, period, right?Jennifer Buckles: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: Okay, so that all makes sense. And so, if they pop up and it's a no match, we just move on, and they're gonna sit in there until or unless.Jennifer Buckles: Until you delete one of the duplicates.Sheila Burleson: Right. Now, here's another question, and this is where we got a little bit more clear on what the holdup was. So the process is not really the holdup. The process works exactly the way you said it did. And you just have to be aware of them. If we have one that pops up that has a potential, but it's not the one, and we put no match in the second street line, it still just kind of sits there until or unless another one pops up. So I think Jonathan's concern is with duplicate PITMs. They could just sit in there and build up and build up. What is the most efficient way for us to keep this from his team having to look at duplicate PITMs every day with the same people that have been reviewed? Is there any efficient way to kind of clear them out?Jennifer Buckles: Okay. PITMs is something completely different.Sheila Burleson: Is that not what we're looking at?Jennifer Buckles: No, this is duplicate ISIRs.Sheila Burleson: Okay, I'm sorry, duplicate ISIRs then.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, so duplicate PITM is when you've created two different banner IDs for the same person, and that's an entirely different process. So this is just duplicate ISIRs, because Banner does not have the capability to match multiple ISIRs for the same person in the match process. It can only handle one at a time. And so, if there's more than one, it's gonna throw them in the duplicate, whether there's a match or not. It doesn't matter. So you're just reviewing the duplicate ISIRs for possible matches, because Banner won't match them up. Even if a match does exist, it won't match them up. So that's all you're doing, is reviewing for matches.And then, to keep them from getting annoying, the people who are doing this are like, \"I've already looked at this person 12 times.\" You start looking at the same ones over and over again, they still don't have a match, it just kind of feels like you're spinning your wheels. That's when deleting the duplicates comes in handy, because that basically clears out your duplicates, and you don't have to continue to look at the same ones, because then you are only saving one transaction. And because it's one, it will no longer be in the duplicate category; it will either roll to hold or suspense until it has a match.Sheila Burleson: So, if we ran that custom job that would remove the duplicates, how is that job set up to know which record we would want?Jennifer Buckles: It only keeps the latest.Kenneth Kirksey: It just keeps the latest.Jonathan Ibarra: Yep.Sheila Burleson: Okay, so as the pile grows, we would want to, for this student, for example, that has two in there, we would want to look at both of those ISIRs and decide which one is the better of the keep. I mean, that's a lot of work, too. What do you guys do?Jennifer Buckles: Ours is different, because we create banner IDs. So if the person doesn't have a match, we would create an ID and match both ISIRs. So, our process is different. I would probably say keep the latest. To me, these students right now are not admitted, not applied; they don't have a banner ID right now, so they may never come to your school. So, I feel like going through all the work to try to figure out which transaction, which one do we want for somebody that may never even come, it's a lot of work for that.When, let's say you did the last one, and the last one had no SAI, but the one before it did, you can always go back and request the transaction before if you needed to, or have the student fix their ISIR. If they messed it up, they need to fix it. So, those are the options. It's not like you delete it, and now you can never get it back. So, I feel like the trade-off you get, where if you could just have a custom job, it's just gonna wipe them out, and you don't have to sit there and waste your brainpower in trying to figure out which one's the best decision. Just keep the latest one, and keep it rolling.Sheila Burleson: I like that. What do you guys think?Kenneth Kirksey: See, that's what I was thinking, because, of course, we want to try to get away from the custom jobs. But…Sheila Burleson: So, doing what Jen says is when we go through.Kenneth Kirksey: If we have a duplicate, we delete everything but the…Jennifer Buckles: Yeah. So, yeah, you can do that manually. You can do that every day if you wanted to, if you don't want to just let them sit there at all. Every time you review a duplicate, you're looking, there's no match, you've got transaction 1, transaction 2, you can delete transaction 1 and move on to the next student. Next time the match runs, it's going to put that transaction 2 either in hold or suspense.Sheila Burleson: If we were to do that, and we're looking at this person, Hesha Allen, and she has two transactions, and we want to keep 2. We're on number 1. Where would we delete it? Just delete record right there? And save? Right here? Thumbs up, right? So this is transaction 1.Jonathan Ibarra: Top right.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, there's a delete at the top right. I'm not 100% sure. I would play with that in SITest and see, because I'm not 100% sure whether it's that checkbox. I don't think it's that checkbox.Sheila Burleson: At this point, with 270 records sitting in there, do we feel like we need to go through all 270 of those, Angie, Kim, to make the pile go down and then just start from there, or do we run a custom job, Kenneth, which I know goes against every fiber of your being?Kenneth Kirksey: Well, I don't mind running the custom job, but it's not gonna be there forever.Jonathan Ibarra: I think for right now, it would be most helpful to really…Sheila Burleson: If we got it cleaned up, and there were 30 records in there, that's way more manageable.Jonathan Ibarra: A lot more manageable. Then you could stay on top of it. Right, because right now, for 26-27, there's over a thousand records, and that was my concern of a constant review after review after review after review. And I don't want my team to be going through that, especially at a time where we do have other things that we're working on. I don't want that to be the one that's taken up a lot of time. So that's where my concern was coming in.Kenneth Kirksey: My vote is when you go through the duplicates, remove everything but the newest.Sheila Burleson: Yes, but we want you to run the job first.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, run the job. We'll run the job first to clean the slate.Sheila Burleson: And then they will… And then as we go forward… And then they will clean as they review.Kenneth Kirksey: And speaking of review, do you want to know how many unsatisfied slate requirements there are out there? Hold down the road. 400. A lot of those people will never show up.Sheila Burleson: We battled that all year.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, I had a question. On this one, in the first block, down at the bottom right, there's the 1 of 6. That's 1 of 6 what?Jennifer Buckles: Go to… click the arrow, go ahead.Sheila Burleson: Ashley Daniels, that's just one out of how many records there are.Jonathan Ibarra: Each page is gonna have about 50 records.Sheila Burleson: Watch. Yeah. This is record 1 of 270.Kenneth Kirksey: record 51 of 270.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, it's because you've got your display set to 50 per page.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, so…Sheila Burleson: Okay, that's just jumping through the list. Yes. Okay. It's not specific to the person you're on at all. It's just following records.Kenneth Kirksey: Gotcha. Okay.Jonathan Ibarra: So, can we make a game plan of just running that custom job, and then we can go through the ones that are sitting out there?Sheila Burleson: Excellent.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, I'll go ahead and do that right after this meeting.Jonathan Ibarra: I was gonna say, Angie, we can schedule a meeting with Kim, and we'll go over each one of the records. But we could do one right now, just so that everybody kind of knows what we're looking at. Or, Sheila, you had one, I think it was record 12 that you ended up finding a potential match? An example, because I think the ones that we were going through just had no match, no match, no match, no match.Sheila Burleson: No, and we found one that had a potential match that also wasn't a match. You want to see that one?Jonathan Ibarra: Yeah, that way we can kind of…Sheila Burleson: I know the name, Chase Brown. Is there any way for me to get there quickly, Jen?Jonathan Ibarra: Just by putting the social on Zoom, but…Jennifer Buckles: social, I think, is the only one thing you can search by. They might be in alphabetical order. I don't know, maybe if you arrow down, see if you can get to B.Sheila Burleson: Alan.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, they're in alphabetical order. too far.Sheila Burleson: There he is. Chase Brown. Went down two. Duplicate check. He has a potential, but it's not a match. So, someone… Oh, where did it go?Jonathan Ibarra: So, would this be the one where we would just do it similar with suspense, putting no match? Because this technically was reviewed, but there was no match.Sheila Burleson: Yeah, where did the no match go that was in there before when we looked at it?Kenneth Kirksey: It might be on the previous record.Sheila Burleson: Oh, did I double arrow? I bet I did. Yeah, that's the only downside, because there's two, so you'd have to put no match on both of them, I guess? Yeah, okay, there it is. I did double arrow, so there's the first one. And it was already reviewed no match, but it's also transaction 1. So since we got a transaction 2, we wanna put no match there, right?Jonathan Ibarra: They will delete. Yeah.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, because since there is a potential match, likely that one would end up in suspense because of the potential match, rather than hold. And so you've already got the no match there, so you wouldn't have to necessarily review it again once it goes into suspense.Sheila Burleson: Tell me about hold.Jennifer Buckles: Hold is what you all do for people where there's nothing. You have no application, no nothing, no social, no name, nothing matches whatsoever. So you just hold onto them. They just go into a different status. It's not suspense, it's not duplicate, it's hold. So they're still there, they're still in the temp table, but they're just on hold. And then every single time the match runs, it re-looks at the whole list to say, is there a match now? If there is a potential match, but they can't exactly match it, it'll put it in suspense. If there's nothing whatsoever that matches, it stays in hold.Sheila Burleson: And do we clear that at the end of a year, or do they just sit there, or does it matter?Jennifer Buckles: I believe they sit there. I don't think you purge anything out.Sheila Burleson: That sounds like us. Okay.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, some schools purge it out, like, all the records that they don't need.Kenneth Kirksey: I don't know if you could probably go back to prior years and see if there's…Jennifer Buckles: But I know you all didn't always do the hold, so there was one point where you were creating new IDs for everybody.Kenneth Kirksey: for everybody.Jennifer Buckles: Yeah, which ended up causing lots more headaches.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, because I was on the registrar side of that.Jennifer Buckles: Hmm.Sheila Burleson: Fun with financial aid! So, does everybody feel okay about what we just learned and all that good stuff?Angie Daugherty: Yeah, it's a little clearer.Jonathan Ibarra: It's a little bit clearer. Angie, let's schedule a meeting with Kim whenever, with her availability, and then we'll go through it.Jennifer Buckles: Go into SITEST and play with the delete. I think it's the top delete is what you select, but maybe just double-check that, because I haven't done suspense in a while.Kenneth Kirksey: I think the most important thing to keep in mind is the duplicate is a separate process from the match. From matching. It will only match if you've got one ISIR. If you've got more than one ISIR, it's never going to match that. So, you have to figure out which ISIR you want to keep.Sheila Burleson: Gosh, none of our kids do more than one.Kenneth Kirksey: Now, while we're all here, and we got a couple of minutes, I want us to give us a final decision on that load button.Jonathan Ibarra: The what now?Kenneth Kirksey: Load button.Jonathan Ibarra: Oh.Kenneth Kirksey: Do we ever want to use that load button?Sheila Burleson: What is that?Angie Daugherty: It's on the instructions on payment. On page 7, and it's circled in red. It's after the thing that says, \"If there are potential matches, you'll see them in the match results, and you will check the social security number, date of birth, and name to confirm the match. Select the ID as indicated above, and click save.\" And then the next screenshot has a screen, and it's got the load circled.Jennifer Buckles: So, here's the issue with why that's a question mark. What load is doing, so when you match something, you're just connecting this ISIR with this student, but nothing is actually attached in Renana. There's no record created in Renana. There's a job that has to run that creates that record, and that's when it stamps it with the ISIR was received on this date, and then that stamp date is the date that the data load process uses when it's picking up new ISIRs to track C flags and comment codes and all of that stuff.So if you load individually, and then for whatever reason, the ISIR process doesn't run tonight, the file didn't come in, something crazy happens with Automic, and it just doesn't run, that ISIR that you loaded today does not get run through all those processes to track the C flags, to track the whatever comment flags, whatever comment codes, whatever tracking codes are required. It misses all of that. Then tomorrow, when that process runs, it's picking up tomorrow's date. Well, if it got loaded today, it's never gonna get picked up. So, when you load, and then the ISIR process doesn't run, you could have a disconnect between your tracking elements.So what we did to remedy that is we have a special load that runs before the ISIR load goes. So, I would say, no, you do not want anybody running load because of the potential for it not to get tracking updated. Maybe you just need to update the directions.The advantage of being able to do load when you're doing duplicates is you can only—so when you run the match, it's gonna then put both duplicates back in duplicate unless one is loaded. So, if you got to your two duplicates, and let's say you found a match, you can only match one at a time, you can't match both of them. So you match one, that one has to load, then when the match runs again, it'll match the other one automatically, because now it's the only one out there. But that's gonna take the night of it running in order for the second one to actually be able to load.So let me just talk through that. You have a duplicate that has a match. You match the first one, you just match it, you don't load it, you just match it. Move on to all the rest of your duplicates. Tonight, when the data load runs, the first job that runs is a load job, so it picks up that match you already did and loads it. Then it goes through the whole ISIR process, which is look for new matches, then it'll match the second one, and load those. So it'll load both of them tonight. Then the newest one will get run through all the tracking and all of that, but both would be matched tonight. But you'd have to wait for tonight, so that other one is still going to be hanging out there in your duplicate list until the ISIR process runs tonight. So the only advantage of being able to load on demand is that you could load it, rerun the match, go ahead and match the second one and load it right then. But, if the ISIR process doesn't run tonight, you've just missed all the tracking. So, I feel like the advantage of having it loaded right now versus the risk of missing tracking updates, I feel like it would be better to do that.Now, there may be a case when you've got an urgent, \"we've got to get this thing loaded, we know what the comment codes are,\" and so maybe special people, like you all, would have that option, to where you could load it if you had to, but you know the implications of, \"if I'm loading this, I need to make sure all the tracking's updated, just in case something happens with the data load tonight.\" But I think the more people you have doing that, the more risk of it missing the tracking and the data load.Sheila Burleson: So, no load. No load. Special circumstance only.Kenneth Kirksey: Jonathan's in charge. In special circumstance only, there should be one person that could do it.Jennifer Buckles: Yep. And then that person understands, \"I'm loading, so I need to make sure tracking is getting updated. I know exactly what should be tracked, and all of that, just in case.\"Jonathan Ibarra: Okay.Sheila Burleson: We can designate.Jonathan Ibarra: He could put me as the designate to make that call.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: So if somebody does the manual load, then they need to make sure… because it does the tracking group, packaging groups, budget group.Sheila Burleson: Would those all be manual then, as well, or…Jennifer Buckles: Yes. I would say this is what they would have to do. They would have to run a tracking group, and then add any tracking codes for comment codes that exist. So those were the things. Budget groups are constantly rerun until the student is packaged, so that's not a problem. That isn't based on dates, and packaging groups are rerun until the student is packaged. So those two would get picked up the following day, but tracking groups and tracking codes would not.Jonathan Ibarra: Unless a new ISIR came in, then it'll pick them up.Sheila Burleson: Manual load, manual tracking.Kenneth Kirksey: And while we're all here, I got another question. We had a situation, Jen, where students, when we ran estimated awards in December, they currently show up as an in-state student, but their tuition and fees was the out-of-state rate. And I'm not sure what happened there. They may have been out of state at the time, and then got changed to in-state.Jennifer Buckles: If you re-budget them at that point, like, so at the point where you say, okay, this is an in-state student with out of state, if you re-budget them, does it update their budget?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, I ran RBRPRC, and it...Jennifer Buckles: Okay, so yeah, that was it. When they got their budget added, they were out of state, and then at some point changed to in-state.Sheila Burleson: Just a timing issue.Kenneth Kirksey: So that's just a… we need to run that report regularly.Jennifer Buckles: Run a report. They would get automatically rebudgeted at the start of the term, but if you're trying to catch them earlier rather than later, then if you have a report, that would catch.Sheila Burleson: Well, what's interesting is the parents and the students are squawking, and it's like, we haven't finally packaged you yet, so just simmer down now, but we've had an unusual amount.Jennifer Buckles: They can see their cost of attendance?Sheila Burleson: Yes, and they don't understand that it's a cost of attendance, and what we don't want is DISPREVs that would be created. There were 131 in that load, and he updated the PBR, BBC, and all the budgets were updated correctly.Jennifer Buckles: Good. Yeah, so it's just a timing thing then.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. I'm alright. We're good?Jonathan Ibarra: Yep.Kenneth Kirksey: We're good. And I've recorded this, I will save it, put it on the drive, and send y'all a link.Jonathan Ibarra: Thank you.Sheila Burleson: Thanks for clarification. I like when you walk things through, it makes it easier to understand.Jennifer Buckles: No problem.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. Good to see you.Jennifer Buckles: You too! Bye.Kenneth Kirksey: Thanks, see y'all.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/isir_processing"],"headers":[{"heading":"Financial Aid Process Review: Duplicate ISIRs and System Procedures","level":1,"id":"Financial_Aid_Process_Review_Duplicate_ISIRs_and_System_Procedures_0"},{"heading":"Understanding and Navigating Duplicate Records","level":2,"id":"Understanding_and_Navigating_Duplicate_Records_0"},{"heading":"Managing and Clearing Duplicate ISIRs","level":2,"id":"Managing_and_Clearing_Duplicate_ISIRs_0"},{"heading":"To Delete Manually or Run a Custom Job?","level":3,"id":"To_Delete_Manually_or_Run_a_Custom_Job?_0"},{"heading":"System Navigation and Record Review","level":2,"id":"System_Navigation_and_Record_Review_0"},{"heading":"The Game Plan for Clearing the Backlog","level":3,"id":"The_Game_Plan_for_Clearing_the_Backlog_0"},{"heading":"Case Study: Reviewing a Potential Match","level":3,"id":"Case_Study_Reviewing_a_Potential_Match_0"},{"heading":"Understanding System Statuses: Hold vs. Suspense","level":2,"id":"Understanding_System_Statuses_Hold_vs._Suspense_0"},{"heading":"The \"Load\" Button: Process and Risks","level":2,"id":"The_\"Load\"_Button_Process_and_Risks_0"},{"heading":"Decision: Restricting Use of the Load Button","level":3,"id":"Decision_Restricting_Use_of_the_Load_Button_0"},{"heading":"Additional Topics and Closing","level":2,"id":"Additional_Topics_and_Closing_0"},{"heading":"Budgeting Discrepancy: In-State vs. Out-of-State","level":3,"id":"Budgeting_Discrepancy_In-State_vs._Out-of-State_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-27-duplicate-isir-processing-how-to-meeting-transcript.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769974574804,"modifiedTime":1769976055673,"sourceSize":24839,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2026-01-27 - Duplicate ISIR Processing How To Meeting - Transcript.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-27-duplicate-isir-processing-how-to-meeting-transcript.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":91,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-30-direct-deposit-email-training-meeting-summary.html":{"title":"2026-01-30 - Direct Deposit Email Training Meeting - Summary","icon":"","description":"\nSheila Burleson\nKenneth Kirksey\nChristine Garst Direct Deposit Update Process: Training on how to identify and flag students with direct deposit in Banner using the User Defined Fields (specifically field 68 in ROAUSDF).\nPopulation Selection (Pop Sel): Running the GLBDATAJ process to generate a count of students currently flagged for direct deposit for the 25-26 aid year.\nSoftware Configuration: Installation and credential setup for WinSCP on Christine’s machine to facilitate file transfers to the jsprod server.\nAccess and Permissions: Troubleshooting Christine’s lack of access to specific Banner forms and DocuWare.

She just got back in from lunch late, because Kim's training went over this morning. So, how are you?Kenneth Kirksey: Good! I just had lunch at Troy's.Sheila Burleson: At where?Kenneth Kirksey: Troy's.Sheila Burleson: Troy's. Ugh, yum. We love Troy's. I'd go eat a big salad!Kenneth Kirksey: I got the open-faced turkey today.Sheila Burleson: How was it?Kenneth Kirksey: Good move.Sheila Burleson: Good. Let me get your other document in here.Christine Garst: Hello.Kenneth Kirksey: Hello!Sheila Burleson: Let me close my door.Christine Garst: How are you, Kenneth?Kenneth Kirksey: I am good.Christine Garst: Good!Sheila Burleson: Okay!Sheila Burleson: So we are taking this on.Kenneth Kirksey: Yup. I shared a link to the instructions with y'all, but I'm going to need to add some things to this as we go.Sheila Burleson: Okay. Did you see those, Christine, in the chat?Christine Garst: Yep.Sheila Burleson: Okay. What do you want us to do? Like, go through it?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, and I would say if Christine's going to be doing this, let's let Christine drive.Sheila Burleson: Okay.Christine Garst: Woohoo! Do I need edit access to this document, or just view access?Sheila Burleson: Let him edit. He'll edit as we go, because we don't know where we're going with it.Christine Garst: Right. Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: So, the first thing is… Okay, and there's actually a step before the first step here.Sheila Burleson: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Let's do it with direct deposit.Sheila Burleson: Christine, yep. In Banner, pull up ROAUSDF and see if you can make sure you can get in there.Christine Garst: You're going to have to say that slower.Sheila Burleson: Sorry, R-O-A USDF. And it should be a field of grids and numbers.Christine Garst: Oh, no, you want to see what I'm seeing? That's all I got.Sheila Burleson: Hit go.Christine Garst: Error.Sheila Burleson: Oh, well, we need a Banner ID in there. Put mine in, 305-8900… 305-588. Okay, so there are rows and rows, columns and columns of fields that we use for different things.Christine Garst: Okay.Sheila Burleson: And one of those is for a direct deposit. So, it'll be in field 68, based on what Kenneth’s… So you would just tab over on the top where the first tab is highlighted, and find the one that would have 68 in it. And there it is. Student has direct deposit. So that's… I just want to make sure you were in there.Christine Garst: Yep.Sheila Burleson: Okay, so…Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, so the first thing is… go to… and you can go ahead and share your screen, Christine.Christine Garst: Fair.Kenneth Kirksey: And go to Banner.Sheila Burleson: Here's...Kenneth Kirksey: And then go to GLRSLCT.Sheila Burleson: We know that field.Christine Garst: Okay?Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, and then application, Financial aid.Christine Garst: Pretty.Sheila Burleson: Yeah, it's yeah.Christine Garst: I got it, I got it, I got it.Kenneth Kirksey: Nope. Creator is KirkseyKB1.Christine Garst: Is it S-E-Y or SY?Kenneth Kirksey: S-E-Y.Christine Garst: KB1?Sheila Burleson: K as in Ken?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Christine Garst: Oh, yeah. All right.Kenneth Kirksey: Let me just look at something real quick. Make sure I tell you the right population selection. Okay, yeah. Okay, for selection ID, do you know how to search for selection IDs in here? Have you done that before?Sheila Burleson: Drop-down little ellipses, like you've watched me do it.Kenneth Kirksey: Yep.Christine Garst: I have watched you do it, but I haven't done it, which means my brain hasn't learned it.Kenneth Kirksey: User not allowed to access GLISLCT?Sheila Burleson: What?Kenneth Kirksey: Well, you don't need to access this.Sheila Burleson: Well, she's going to need... Stupid.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, we need to give her access to that.Sheila Burleson: For sure. I don't know why that's not on there. I thought we were golden.Kenneth Kirksey: Should she still have the same Banner access as you, Sheila?Sheila Burleson: It's fine with me, but I have more than you need, but you won't know that unless you do something that you're not supposed to by accident. There's some stuff that… let's just update her to mine. I don't care.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. So, go to GLBDATAJ.Christine Garst: For the selection ID?Sheila Burleson: No, no, no.Kenneth Kirksey: No, no.Sheila Burleson: X out.Kenneth Kirksey: I need to, yeah, X out.Sheila Burleson: GLBDATAJ. She's not going to have that either.Christine Garst: Nope.Sheila Burleson: She got no Gs. Okay, well…Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, well, Sheila…Sheila Burleson: Looks like I'm driving.Kenneth Kirksey: You want to drive?Sheila Burleson: Either way.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, and I'm recording this, and so I will save it and share it with y'all, so y'all will have it for reference.Christine Garst: Okay.Sheila Burleson: My face looks like it's glowing.Christine Garst: Haha!Sheila Burleson: Does it look really, really white to you guys?Christine Garst: Yeah. Okay, great.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, you look like…Sheila Burleson: I wonder why that is.Kenneth Kirksey: You stole my blinds? It's because of the dark background behind you.Sheila Burleson: Weird.Kenneth Kirksey: The balance on the camera is trying to do an average exposure instead of an exposure for the face. I wonder… I think there's actually a way to set that.Sheila Burleson: I got to do something, I feel like I'm… yeah. Oh, that didn't work.Kenneth Kirksey: Let me look at my settings.Sheila Burleson: How about now? Nope.Kenneth Kirksey: That'll work.Sheila Burleson: Oh, I don't know how to get rid of it. There it is. Those are cute!Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, good to go.Sheila Burleson: Okay, well, I'll fiddle with that later. Let me get my banner up, which I've been kicked out of again.Christine Garst: I need to work on DocuWare as well. I tried to log in this morning, and it's telling me that I have an invalid login.Sheila Burleson: When you log into DocuWare, you don't log in the way you think you're supposed to. You need to choose… what is it under there? Google login?Christine Garst: Log in through Microsoft?Sheila Burleson: Microsoft, yes.Christine Garst: Yeah, it won't let me.Sheila Burleson: It won't let you do that either?Christine Garst: No.Sheila Burleson: Hmm, I've always thought that was weird anyway. But…Kenneth Kirksey: I'll make a note to submit a ticket for that. Okay, so application, finaid, Selection, Creator ID, KirkseyKB1, and…Sheila Burleson: that.Kenneth Kirksey: And then selection ID is… well, I closed that window. I think it's students with direct deposit, underscores between the words.Sheila Burleson: Well, dang ya.Kenneth Kirksey: Nope.Sheila Burleson: Huh?Kenneth Kirksey: Deposit, singular. No, we need to be in GLBDATAJ, not GLRSLCT.Sheila Burleson: Oh, I went back to where you told her to go.Kenneth Kirksey: First.Sheila Burleson: So that's different. Where do you want me to be? Is there a parameter?Kenneth Kirksey: Click go. Okay, selection identifier should be students with direct deposit.Sheila Burleson: All right, is it a database or a Python printer?Kenneth Kirksey: Database. And Christine, if you don't… if you leave that blank, you won't be able to get any output.Christine Garst: Hmm.Kenneth Kirksey: So, always put database in there. There are some that have Python, but those are usually pre-populated. Okay, selection ID, application code…Sheila Burleson: That needs to be you.Kenneth Kirksey: And I…Sheila Burleson: It's not Jones, is it?Kenneth Kirksey: No. Creator, obviously, is KirkseyKB1.Sheila Burleson: Is that it? Is that all there is in there?Kenneth Kirksey: That's it. Okay. And then click the save parameter set as… Christine, what that does is, if you have to run this again, it will save what you've already entered, so you don't have to enter everything in again.Christine Garst: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: And that will add that to the…Sheila Burleson: You want me to run it?Kenneth Kirksey: Yes.Sheila Burleson: What does that mean?Kenneth Kirksey: You have to add the AIDY code.Sheila Burleson: Where is it?Christine Garst: The very bottom.Kenneth Kirksey: The very bottom.Christine Garst: There you go.Sheila Burleson: Didn't see that one. You have to be in that bottom field somewhere, your cursor in that bottom field, or it won't run.Kenneth Kirksey: Nope. Okay, so what this has done is it is running a report of all of the students that currently have direct deposit. And we've indicated that by putting the value in that user-defined field.Sheila Burleson: So, the user-defined field is that number 68 in ROAUSDF. Christine. That's what those are in all of those columns of fields. They're called user-defined fields.Christine Garst: Okay.Sheila Burleson: And that number 68, you explain how it attaches to this job, Kenneth, because I can't explain that.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, the number… the 68 is just… we've set that field to be the direct deposit field.Christine Garst: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: If there's a Y in that field, then the student has direct deposit. And we're going to populate that in the next step.Sheila Burleson: What we are doing is we're continuously contacting students and telling them to set up direct deposit. Set it up, set it up, set it up.Christine Garst: Right.Sheila Burleson: As we're sending them, new students are coming in, but old students who didn't do it are still on there, but students who did follow our advice and did it drop off. So we have to clean the list each time, and we're going to do repeats, but we're also going to have some new, and we're going to have some fall off.Christine Garst: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: Okay? And so… Do you want the output for this job?Kenneth Kirksey: Yes, so we need to go to GLAEXTR.Sheila Burleson: Do you want this output?Kenneth Kirksey: No.Sheila Burleson: Do you need to see it for any reason?Kenneth Kirksey: No.Sheila Burleson: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Although, well… wait a second, we might be able to get what we want here instead of GLAEXTR.Sheila Burleson: Right.Kenneth Kirksey: Click on… Go back to GLBDATAJ. Okay. And hold on a sec, nope. I'm writing down steps here.Sheila Burleson: Well, don't you want me to open it and see if there's anything worthwhile in here? All it's going to tell us is what just ran.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, what we're looking for is a count.Sheila Burleson: Okay. Then, yeah, we should… Is that correct based on your prior jobs? So, 30,234?Kenneth Kirksey: Yep. Yeah, we just need to make a note of that number, because we send the before and after numbers to Allison. She wants to know how many we've added.Sheila Burleson: Okay. So is that just pulling data for… Where's that number coming from? That's a large number.Kenneth Kirksey: That's everybody in 25-26 that has a 25-26 direct deposit flag. That'll include students that aren't attending.Sheila Burleson: Okay, are there duplicates in there?Kenneth Kirksey: No.Sheila Burleson: So, it would be anybody who ever had it, even if they're not here, but they were at some point in 24, 25?Kenneth Kirksey: Yes.Sheila Burleson: Or they applied and set all the stuff up and didn't come.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: Okay, okay. That's a lot. That's a lot of num… that's a lot number. That's like 10,000 more than we should have. Like, 15,000 more than we should have. All right, now what do we do?Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. Okay, then the next step is we get the list of students with direct deposit from Ann Heath.Sheila Burleson: Okay. Have you gotten one?Kenneth Kirksey: Well, we already did January back on January 1st. We get that file at the first of every month.Sheila Burleson: Is she sending these somewhere automatically?Kenneth Kirksey: We request it.Sheila Burleson: Okay. So, is it something like if I chat her right now, she can send it to me?Kenneth Kirksey: Possibly. Give it a shot.Sheila Burleson: So, I need January 1st through January 30th? I need January.Kenneth Kirksey: Well, no, she just sends us… She just sends us the list of students that have direct deposit. We only add the ones that are new.Sheila Burleson: Oh, she just does that…Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: that around the first of every month.Kenneth Kirksey: Yes.Sheila Burleson: Oh, okay. You… okay. I misunderstood what you said when you were saying we already did January. Do you have a list you can send me? Okay. She does not appear to be online, but let's say we have a list. Can we move forward just to see what the next steps are, or do we need to stop?Kenneth Kirksey: It's going to be a lot easier to do if we have a list. It's not going to make much sense without it.Sheila Burleson: Then I'm not going to waste our time.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay.Sheila Burleson: And since I didn't ask for it in advance, because I didn't really know how that was working, and I should have asked you.Kenneth Kirksey: Huh.Sheila Burleson: And I want Christine to have… yeah. Yeah, the FTP access for Christine. Did you see my request for the secure file transfer for both Christine and Jonathan? He's no longer… he no longer has WinSCP on his machine, because he got a new machine.Kenneth Kirksey: Oh, well, he's still got access, he just doesn't have WinSCP.Sheila Burleson: Right.Kenneth Kirksey: Because he uploads stuff all the time.Sheila Burleson: Yeah, but he's doing it through the new way you're using data load. Remember I told you the other day, he told me that WinSCP was going away?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: And he didn't understand that was only for the data load processes, but not for the rest of us. And so I told him, he's like, \"Oh, well, I want it back.\" And I'm like, \"You don't have it?\" He said, \"No, I have a new machine, but I can't access it anymore.\" So, I don't know. But Christine definitely cannot, so if you could get both of them back.Kenneth Kirksey: I think… well, I think WinSCP is on the software center that you can download it yourself.Sheila Burleson: I think you can, but didn't you tell me that we can't… and then how do we get permissions for our institution?Kenneth Kirksey: Well, that's what I have to submit the ticket to get that.Sheila Burleson: Right, okay. Well, we can go ahead and download, that's not a big deal.Kenneth Kirksey: Actually, no, because for this, no, for this, we're not using her user account, we're using a Finaid account, so I can just give her those credentials. So, while we're here…Sheila Burleson: We start. She needs that for Banner emails.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: I mean, she's going to need WinSCP for other things.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, let's go ahead, since we're here already, and we got time, let's just go ahead and install that on her machine.Sheila Burleson: All right!Kenneth Kirksey: So, yeah, Christine, share your screen.Christine Garst: What do you mean? Is she back on the right screen?Sheila Burleson: Turn your cartoons off and pay attention.Christine Garst: That's funny. No, I need to get a camera for… because I'm using my laptop camera, but that little screen is so small. So my zoom is here, but my big screens are here, so I need to get a camera for my…Sheila Burleson: They're in the… they're in the cage. Can I get a key out of… does Debra leave the keys here?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, but I don't know that they're accessible.Sheila Burleson: She's got a key to the cage.Kenneth Kirksey: Yep, you have to check with her. Okay, Christine. Yep. Go down to the search bar and type, type in Software Center. Open that… Cameron! Hi, bro.Sheila Burleson: Hmm.Christine Garst: Maybe?Kenneth Kirksey: Are you on the wired network or wireless?Christine Garst: While they're looking at cable. Wireless.Kenneth Kirksey: Jeez.Sheila Burleson: She did her… she did her…Kenneth Kirksey: That's the problem.Sheila Burleson: Why?Kenneth Kirksey: Wireless… the Wi-Fi in that corner of the building's bad.Sheila Burleson: Are you kidding me? I'm like, I'm on it.Christine Garst: I really had a problem.Kenneth Kirksey: You're not in that corner.Sheila Burleson: That corner of the building is bad. Wireless.Kenneth Kirksey: It's not… the connection is not great.Sheila Burleson: Do I need to ethernetter? I think we do with that, did I leave that cord in your other old office, or did you?Christine Garst: I think I might have one in this office. I'm going to dig through some drawers.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah… Whatever. Okay. Go up to the search bar at the top right.Christine Garst: Great, you know? Surge bar in the top right, yeah.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, type… just start typing WIN, W-I-N, SCP… And then hit enter. Yep, there it is. So, double-click on that. Install.Christine Garst: I think this has been the biggest learning curve for me, of learning the programs, the softwares and the programs. You all speak like a different language.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, and it'll take you about a year. Well, that's… I've been here two years, and I still ain't 100%.Christine Garst: It's impressive.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. Where'd Sheila go?Christine Garst: I don't know. She's just gone.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, well… We'll continue with Adler, she can watch the recording.Christine Garst: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, go down to your search bar in the taskbar.Christine Garst: Oh, I hear her.Kenneth Kirksey: Type WinSCP.Christine Garst: Well, I'm coming. Thank you. Okay. Did you find an ether, or is it happening with that? I mean, it's happening. It's not another, okay. We'll do that later. She's coming back. I have a camera now. I'll set that up later.Kenneth Kirksey: He didn't kick me off. Yes, it did. That is inconvenient. Okay. So, yeah, open WinSCP.Christine Garst: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: All right, so let me pull up my credentials here. Copy and paste this in the Google chat, then. Okay. Put what I just sent you in the chat for the host name.Christine Garst: Oh, boy. Well, let's see… Where'd he go? This one.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Christine Garst: Ace.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, and take out the HTTPS. We just want jsprod.appstate.edu.Christine Garst: Should I take that slash away as well?Kenneth Kirksey: Yes. Okay. The username is P as in Paul, F-I-N-A-I-D.Christine Garst: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: The password is… Let me see… And this is all lowercase.Christine Garst: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: S. U. Percent sign…Christine Garst: Okay?Kenneth Kirksey: F-A-M… 101. And then click on the Advanced button. Directories. Click on directories. Okay, and then I am going to send you another thing in the chat to paste in there.Christine Garst: Kay?Kenneth Kirksey: And just copy that.Christine Garst: In remote or local?Kenneth Kirksey: Remote. Okay, and we need to remove all of that HTTPS stuff. Remove everything up to the slash u01 from the front.Christine Garst: Oh.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah. But leave the U01… leave the slash U01, just everything before that. Okay. Now click, click OK. Then click Save. And click Save Password, it says not recommended. I don't care.Christine Garst: Okay.Sheila Burleson: I used to. Yeah, click OK.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. Now, we should be able to log in. Let's try it. Click Accept. Okay. You're in.Christine Garst: Boom!Kenneth Kirksey: This, and this is the folder where we will place the list of banner IDs that Ann sends us.Christine Garst: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: And then Banner will pick it up from there.Christine Garst: Yep. So this is what I've seen Sheila do, like 20 times now.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: Like, pop cells of IDs to send an email. Yeah, we're just going to… are we going to… are we batch posting something, or…Kenneth Kirksey: Yes.Sheila Burleson: we're going to batch post the Y to the field? Yeah. Okay, I gotcha.Kenneth Kirksey: Nope.Sheila Burleson: Do you remember the first time I was showing you how to do an email, and I said, \"Oh, I'm doing the wrong… the wrong process?\"Christine Garst: Yeah. Yeah.Sheila Burleson: I was trying to batch post instead of upload an email. So you're going to learn it after all!Christine Garst: Yeah. Great.Sheila Burleson: How to batch post.Sheila Burleson: You guys, though, let's take a breather, because I really would rather do it hands-on, and I'm not hearing back from Ann, and I have to get Connor at 3, so I don't want to get in it without, when we get stuck. So can I send another invite for next week, and we just finish up?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, when you get the file from Ann.Sheila Burleson: Right. Okay, that's what we'll do. Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay.Sheila Burleson: I think that's a good plan, but thank you for getting that for her, that's huge. Because now we can do other fun stuff.Christine Garst: Yay! Thank you, Kenneth.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay.Sheila Burleson: All right, if we don't talk… weekend!Kenneth Kirksey: Oh, Christine, I was going to ask how the house search was going.Christine Garst: We closed on our house this week! I know!Sheila Burleson: It's so cute!Kenneth Kirksey: Where is it?Christine Garst: It's just off of Brown's Chapel.Sheila Burleson: Okay. Other side of the world from you, and me. Yeah. So pretty.Christine Garst: It's cute, it's a cute little mountain cottage kind of… kind of thing, so…Sheila Burleson: It's adorable.Christine Garst: Oh my gosh.Kenneth Kirksey: Did you have to offer your firstborn as collateral?Christine Garst: But we actually did pretty good on it, I'm proud of us.Kenneth Kirksey: No.Christine Garst: Got a good deal.Sheila Burleson: She negotiated.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Christine Garst: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: Great.Christine Garst: We really negotiated.Kenneth Kirksey: Yep.Sheila Burleson: I'm a hackler, so…Kenneth Kirksey: You're fortunate.Christine Garst: Yeah. We were, like, 100K less than the neighbor's house that sold four months ago. So…Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, people are not getting what they're asking these days.Sheila Burleson: No, the market has changed again, but I'm glad for you.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Sheila Burleson: When my son bought his, it was like we couldn't put in an offer fast enough. He lost place after place after place, because people were just buying them sight unseen. It was just… it was ridiculous at top dollar, and he made out okay. I wish we could have waited it out, but he bought a townhouse in Wilmington, and I love it, and I'm happy for him, but it was grueling.Kenneth Kirksey: Well, we've got one of the units in our development. We live in townhomes, too.Sheila Burleson: Hmm.Kenneth Kirksey: He's got his listed for $500K.Sheila Burleson: Wow.Kenneth Kirksey: It's a 2,700 square foot, three bedroom, two bath.Sheila Burleson: That's pretty big. That's a pretty big townhouse. That's as big as my house.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah. And I'm four bedroom. Yeah. Perfect.Sheila Burleson: and a half baths.Kenneth Kirksey: That ain't what he paid for it.Sheila Burleson: That ain't what he pays for it.Kenneth Kirksey: All right, well, y'all have a good weekend.Christine Garst: Thank you.

How are you?Sheila Burleson: Ugh! I'm lazy sleepy today. I was so comfortable in my bed this morning that I just was like, no, I'm not leaving my bed. Ever. And I was like, you have a child that has to be picked up in 20 minutes, and you must shower. So I did. Yeah, it was definitely one of those days here. Boom.Sheila Burleson: Allison was just sending that Condition 2 is in effect through Saturday. What does that do for your interviews? Are you still doing them?Wendy Ray: I'm hoping that we can still do it. Since it's virtual, I feel like all the faculty are ready and willing. Allison, Bailey and I, Anthony and Sydney, will all be working tomorrow, even though it's a condition 2. It'll be notated somewhere, I guess, that that's happening, but we'll be there, working. We gotta get through this. We can't keep postponing.Kenneth Kirksey: Huh.Sheila Burleson: If you need help, Wendy, let me know, I'm around.Wendy Ray: Okay. I will. I think we're pretty good. We've got, for the most part, Chancellor's is ready to go. They're done. I've got two or three students I'm trying to get interviews scheduled for for Beaver, but other than that, I think we're pretty good to go. But I'll let you know.Alison Rabil: What are you looking at, Kenneth?Kenneth Kirksey: I'm looking at the converting estimated awards to actual. I just need to share the document with y'all.Alison Rabil: Okay. I know we wanted to look at summer at some point, but what was the other thing that we wanted?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, you had mentioned you wanted to look at this. Because we were getting ready to send out… I'll pull the... I just put a link to the document in the Zoom chat. When are we planning on regarding the actual award?Alison Rabil: Well, the reason I brought it up was because we have the state aid stuff out. We know that it's gonna stay the same, right? So is that the only thing at this point that is estimated in our packages? The rest of it is…Sheila Burleson: Is Pell solid?Alison Rabil: Yeah, I don't think it's gonna change. And we're not gonna award SEOG to the first-year students until possibly later, because we've got so little of it anyway, I don't think it'll make that much of a difference. But that's not in the packaging rules, so I don't think we have to worry about that piece of it.Sheila Burleson: So, once we get the state, which is our last thing that we usually wait on, is that correct? We should be able to.Alison Rabil: And we have that. It's not gonna change. It's the same…Sheila Burleson: Oh, right, but is that our… is that for our future planning, when the state is concrete, we can go to actual?Angie Daugherty: Usually state and Pell, when we get the notification about that. We award, and it's been early March.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, I was looking. Last year, it was in March sometime.Alison Rabil: Well, we can wait until early March, but since they told us about the state, I wanted to see if we wanted to at least walk through whatever we need to do. So that even if we sent it early March, I don't want to send out another set of estimated awards in February if we already know we're going to send… you know what I mean? If we can pretty much, maybe at the end of February, go ahead and send out our actual awards to our first years. Or to our prospective first years, and then we could kind of keep spitting those out, I guess.Alison Rabil: But we don't mail those, which is probably good. And then we would need to figure out the communications, if we're not mailing them, to let people know that new stuff is out there. And I would want to notify parents, if we can, include the parents. I don't know what we've done in the past, in terms of how we've notified people. And it wouldn't go on my Mountaineer, right?Sheila Burleson: No, but if we have estimated awarded, and we update that—for example, state from the $2,000 up to the $3,026 for a zero—that automatically sends a message to a student that something has changed on their account. It's very generic, it just says, check your student account, something has changed, or your financial aid.Alison Rabil: Yeah, but most of these kids are not going to have access to AppalNet. They're never gonna look.Sheila Burleson: Right, I'm saying…Alison Rabil: I'm wondering whether…Sheila Burleson: I'm saying the generic message would not help them anyway. So for communication, we could grab the students and whatever parent information there is from Slate, I guess, or maybe from Spaden, if they've listed a parent contact? Or from the FAFSA, I guess.Alison Rabil: Is there a way—maybe this is a question for Bailey upstairs—is there a way to update MyMountaineer without necessarily sending out a new award letter or anything, just to update the award, so that if they go into MyMountaineer, they'll see the updated award, and we can push them to My Mountaineer as opposed to…Wendy Ray: I think there is.Alison Rabil: If there is, then that could be helpful. Because the state awards are going to be, in many cases, more than what we actually estimated, which would be to our benefit.Sheila Burleson: How does that information get pushed into Slate, into My Mountaineer?Kenneth Kirksey: The job runs every day.Wendy Ray: Yeah.Kenneth Kirksey: And it looks for any changed awards and pushes that over to Slate.Kenneth Kirksey: Well, that's perfect, then. It would update my Mountaineer portal, right?Sheila Burleson: Cool.Kenneth Kirksey: Now, I don't know how Bailey decides what emails to send, when to who.Alison Rabil: Well, we could work with her to send out a special one that says, \"Hey, your award's been finalized.\" I would want as many of Wendy's awards in there as possible. So Wendy, for her first years anyway, after this round, would most of yours be in for first years after next week?Wendy Ray: Yeah. Yeah, by the end of next week. All of them will have their initial offer out. They will be done.Sheila Burleson: So we could go earlier than usual, and that would be good.Alison Rabil: Yeah, if we aim for mid to late February or whatever, we're not in a huge rush.Alison Rabil: That begs the question, then, how do we get set up for actual awards?Kenneth Kirksey: And that's what the document I just sent to y'all is about. The thing we would need to do before we started running it is that point four, \"check the regular packaging setup.\" We just need to review all of those things to make sure everything is set up correctly. So, I'd say let's schedule a meeting, or we could use one of our regular Fridays.Alison Rabil: I think that'd be good. It's probably good to have Jonathan here, too.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah. Okay, let me make that a note. The process is we've got all these estimated awards out there. So we run a pop sel to get all of the people that have estimated awards that are in that packaging group, and we set a null package date. We don't cancel it. And then, right now, we have the estimated rule.Sheila Burleson: rule.Kenneth Kirksey: When we're running 26-27, it sees that estimated rule, runs it first, and then stops. So nothing else happens in 26-27 package. Once we deactivate that ESTFR rule and run packaging, then it's going to start doing the regular packaging process. So, the basic flip over is find everybody that's got an estimated award, set a null package day for all those awards, disable the ESTFR rule, and we're done. Then we start running regular packaging.Alison Rabil: And then, I still would want to leave it off in banner so that they can't see it, right?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, and Info Access is off globally for 26-27.Alison Rabil: Yeah, I wouldn't turn that on until we turn it on for everybody. Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: As far as the summer awarding process, let me pull up our chain. I'll share that. Of course, it timed out on me right now, and I need to see it. Okay. So, this is the summer awarding chain. And I am going to review all of this. I've got all of the steps in my notes with Jen to figure out what we need to do to update it for 25-26. I think it's mostly just going to be changing some parameters. And, I'm also working on a document that explains each one of these steps so that everybody can kind of understand what it's doing.Kenneth Kirksey: Question I had… The Summer State Grants killed us last year. We were never able to get that working correctly. And I just got off the financial aid UNC Leeds meeting, and there, apparently, there is a way to… what killed us was we were trying to calculate the amount of the awards and match what was on the state grants portal. We couldn't get the data from the state grants portal. This year, we can get the data from the State Grants Portal. And there is a way to have Tracy at the UNC System Office automatically generate our file every day and put it on their FTP site. And then we can automate downloading that file and then running it through the state grant awarder. So, we don't have to manually download it, we don't have to calculate it, it should just go. And I volunteered to be on a working group for state grants with some of the other UNC financial aid people. So, I will keep y'all up to date on what we figure out.Alison Rabil: We also had the issue of we awarded it… didn't we award our aid alphabetically, as opposed to when they actually registered or something? And we can't do that. It needs to be by the date that they actually register.Kenneth Kirksey: That was…Sheila Burleson: Oh my god.Kenneth Kirksey: That was for ACOG, wasn't it?Alison Rabil: It was, but we got rid of that. So, is ACOG even in this? It would be nice if we could do summer ACOG and just award it out of the… whatever it is, 8053, or whatever the heck number it is. But it would have to be by the FAFSA date and not by their… whether their name started with A, otherwise we can't do it.Sheila Burleson: That was just an error, and we fixed it. But we fixed it by sort of taking it off and then reposting it, and I don't…Alison Rabil: So if we can actually build it into the formula, is what I mean.Kenneth Kirksey: I will make a note.Sheila Burleson: I think we took it out, or thought about not putting it in, because we didn't know if we were going to have any money.Alison Rabil: But we have money this time, and we have about as much as we had last year. We have, like, $1.3 million or something, so we have a fair amount.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, it wasn't part of this automated process.Sheila Burleson: That's because we didn't know what we were doing with it last year. Can we make it a part?Kenneth Kirksey: I will, when I review this, I will figure that out.Sheila Burleson: That would be great.Kenneth Kirksey: Now, I think the issue is because we have to look at how much we have and then award it based on who was here first. We might be able to automate it as a separate process, but I don't think it would work as part of the daily process, because ACOG doesn't get awarded like that. We usually award ACOG in that one big chunk, correct?Alison Rabil: For our regular packages, you mean? It gets awarded based on a need criteria, like they have a… I think for 26-27, it's less than $1 SAI or something like that.Sheila Burleson: $1.Alison Rabil: And we're just gonna… but then we shut it off when we ran out of money. That's why we actually had more money left over, because we never turned it back on, which we should have, but that was my fault. Anyway.Angie Daugherty: And it gets… it gets awarded, though, with regular packaging.Kenneth Kirksey: Correct.Angie Daugherty: It's not separate.Sheila Burleson: Right.Alison Rabil: Right, it's not separate during the year. So if we package this summer on a… So it's based on registration date for summer, not on the FAFSA receipt date. And so, I'm wondering…Sheila Burleson: So that's the difference. The other criteria would be the same, but the regular year does not take into consideration a date range that we want for summer. So we would have to just add in the same criteria, but with a date in addition…Alison Rabil: I have a question. If we packaged on a daily basis for summer and use the same need criteria—so they're high-need kids, however we define that in terms of the SAI—if we repackaged on a daily basis, wouldn't it pick up whoever registered?Sheila Burleson: Theoretically, yeah.Alison Rabil: So that that would handle the…Sheila Burleson: We wouldn't have to write in a…Alison Rabil: ...need to manage the people who registered first. They would get packaged first, because if you were doing it on a regular basis, you would be packaging whoever fell into the registered summer group. So wouldn't that theoretically take care of it?Kenneth Kirksey: No? So, question is… As far as the automated, yeah, we can award ACOG daily, like we do fall-spring. But is there a chance that when we do our first run, we're gonna use up all the ACOG funds?Sheila Burleson: There's a chance.Kenneth Kirksey: Because that's where the problem is. Because if we run it through the automated process, that's not going to look at their registration dates. You can't sort them by registration date.Alison Rabil: Right. Well, maybe we could just look at how many people were registered, and how much we have, and who would qualify, and sort of see how many that would be. And we could cost that out pretty easily if we just knew how many people have fallen into that first summer aid run. But if we started fairly soon after registration opened, as opposed to waiting a couple weeks and then having a massive group, if we could start when registration starts, that would be better, right? And that would mean smaller groups of people would become eligible every day.Sheila Burleson: If we did that, and we package as we go, what problem do we run into with change in registration, drops? Is that impactful in any way anybody can think of? That's typically why we wait, is so that they can get as solid as can be. So, is it more impactful to do that and have to constantly update someone's… and will it constantly update someone's packaging if they've made changes up until the drop-add point? And in that case, is that going to mess us up in terms of packaging as we go and using the date as our common denominator to award the ACOG? Do we write a rule in there for the ACOG, or do we do it this way?Kenneth Kirksey: The way it works, those first pop sels look for anybody who has registration has changed.Sheila Burleson: Okay.Kenneth Kirksey: And then it runs them through the process. Now… we've got the cancel offers, but those are for sub and unsub loans. And you remember, too, on this summer process, we are totally bypassing the regular packaging process. We're not using RPE pack today. So, all of the awards are getting added manually… well, not manually, but not through RPE package.Sheila Burleson: A custom job, Kenneth Kirksey.Kenneth Kirksey: No.Alison Rabil: Well, it's like we post the aid, right? So it's pretty much… Okay. So…Kenneth Kirksey: So, I'm not sure that this is set up for removing aid.Alison Rabil: Or adjusting it based on…Angie Daugherty: I think the Pell adjusts, but the other…Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, the Pell does, because we run it through RPE Pell, J.Angie Daugherty: Right, but I think the other does not, and then we just adjust after drop-add.Alison Rabil: In chunks, right? So we let people register, and then we award it. When we get enough people that we spend all of our money, we award it. And then two weeks later, we check registrations, and we sort of do an adjusted award. I mean, we would have to sort of regularly adjust specifically ACOG and not put it in. I don't know.Kenneth Kirksey: I'll look and see how we handled it last year.LeeAnn Barnes: If it doesn't adjust, it may create Discreps too, right? So…Alison Rabil: Yeah, the goal would be to touch it as little as possible, and by as few people as possible.Kenneth Kirksey: The Biz-Ops team, and…Alison Rabil: Alright. Maybe it's a point between registration and when the bill is due for summer, because they start registering for summer pretty, like, what, March?Wendy Ray: April 1st.Alison Rabil: Okay. And when's the bill due? Anybody know when summer bill is due? Like, maybe we could do a post right before the summer bill is due.Wendy Ray: I can look up Adam's calendar, hang on.Alison Rabil: In any case, that would be a good date to work around, so that if we're gonna award the ACOG, then their bill would at least reflect the most money we can give them for summer based on whatever their registration is at that point, right before the bill, so that the bill can take it into account, I would think, right?Wendy Ray: Memo aid is 4/17, first bill is 4/22.Alison Rabil: So, something around 4/15.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. Well, I will review my packaging documentation and answer these questions, and if my documentation doesn't answer it, I'll check with Jen. And then also schedule a meeting to review the packaging setup for 26-27. So, I guess all of us, plus Jonathan, should be involved in that. So, we might make that our next Friday. That sounds like a good plan.LeeAnn Barnes: I was looking back at last year, and it looks like they sent the Dear Colleague letter, or whatever, about the Pell on January 31st. February 1st is the deadline for them to do that. It can change if Congress decides to go back in up until March 14th, so that could be why we wait till March, but usually they don't.Sheila Burleson: My fear this time would be that they would decrease it. But hopefully they're not going down that road.Kenneth Kirksey: While I'm pulling up my calendar... Registration for Summer One opens in April.Alison Rabil: It was April 1, right?Alison Rabil: And when did we say that the aid gets memoed?Wendy Ray: For Summer 1, Memo Aid is 4/17. And summer 2 is 5/29.Alison Rabil: And so, do we want to put in a placeholder date for posting summer aid by 4/15, at least the first round or something like that, so it hits before memo?Kenneth Kirksey: 4/15…Alison Rabil: Yeah, 4/15, so it would be before the memo hits. Just so we remember, I guess.LeeAnn Barnes: You want to do that lock Pell before you start the awarding process, just so the Pell doesn't calculate wrong. So I know you have it the same day, but that should go above. You'll lock both, fall and spring.Alison Rabil: I don't think LeeAnn would be alone.LeeAnn Barnes: I'm very protective of my Pell numbers. I want them to stay accurate.Alison Rabil: And that does not go unappreciated.Kenneth Kirksey: What would the RPDSBJ for summer be? I don't have that on here. When do we start disbursement?Wendy Ray: For Summer 1 is 5/17. And summer 2 is 7/1 on his calendar.Angie Daugherty: Doesn't the RPDSBJ run memos, too, though?Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah.Angie Daugherty: Then it needs to start before that, if we're memoing on 4/17.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, this one started 4/18 last year.Angie Daugherty: So that one should be 4/17.Alison Rabil: I thought we weren't running RPJ for summer.Kenneth Kirksey: No, disbursements, yeah.Sheila Burleson: memoing.Alison Rabil: Oh, okay. Just not packaging. Okay, got it. I got all my RPs and DISBs all mixed up.Kenneth Kirksey: What was the date that you were looking for? Registration for Summer One?Alison Rabil: Oh, okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Last day to add a class summer…Alison Rabil: Summer 1 is… May 27th.Angie Daugherty: But it is drop-add. First day of classes is the 26th, and the last day to add is 27th, so that is our drop-add.Alison Rabil: And then Summer Two, it's July 7th.Kenneth Kirksey: Yeah, we're doing it by date, because that's when… basically, anything for summer goes… spring is from January 1st through, I think May 15th. Then summer 2 is May 15th through July 29th. Fall is 8/1 through 12/31. Okay. Do we have an updated bill for…Wendy Ray: What are you looking for? Sorry.Kenneth Kirksey: Updated bill.Wendy Ray: He doesn't have that listed on his calendar, it's just his first bill.Angie Daugherty: The updated bill is usually after drop-add, when we adjust. So it would be after class is start.Alison Rabil: We should put Flight Path on there, too. That May 26th date for the first date is good for Flight Path, too. That's the first day of summer for Flight Path.Angie Daugherty: Allison, we try to forget them.Alison Rabil: I'm sorry. I'm trying to be good about not being like, \"shit, we forgot them again.\" What is their last day to add? Is that the same, too? It says, summer day, last day to add, last day to drop, May 28th for them. So they're one day different. How friggin' annoying.Kenneth Kirksey: I ran CPOS test yesterday, and it looks like BR Test 9 banner is talking with Degree Works. It didn't throw a bunch of errors, but it also didn't process any students. So, at least that's progress. I'm working on… Jen doesn't have CPOS access. So, I submitted a ticket this morning to get her access so she can take a look at things. And Sheila, I will probably be scheduling a meeting next week with you, me, and Jen to continue on the CPOS.Sheila Burleson: Cool.Alison Rabil: Can you just put me in there? But don't schedule it around me, schedule over whatever's there, but if I can make it, I'd like to just listen in. Because I told the UAC people that I would let them know what the steps were. Not that Sheila can't do that, but I want to just sort of listen in, see what needs to happen.Kenneth Kirksey: Will do.Kenneth Kirksey: And also shared yesterday, I emailed y'all, I put those reports on the Flight Path dashboard for people that were admitted as PKH, but they're not in a PKH budget, or people admitted as not PKH, but they are in a PKH budget. There's none of the latter at this point. But we do have a lot of PKH that are in, like, no admin, standard, cancel, etc.Alison Rabil: And we should look through…Sheila Burleson: Yeah, why are they like that, and what do we need to do?Alison Rabil: Angie, can you work with Jonathan to kind of take a look and see what the story is there, and let us know what we need to do?Angie Daugherty: It is where they get… it's where they switch back and forth, and it doesn't get picked up, their new switch. I don't know if that's something Banner does, or if we just have to manually do them. We have been manually doing them, but if there's 4,000 PTH students and they keep doing it, it's probably something we need to look at about a system doing it. I just have been manually updating.Alison Rabil: But even so, it's only going to get bigger. They're asking us now, which makes total sense, to start thinking about those things that we may only have 10 right now, we may have 150 a year from now. So if we can think of ways to adjust that now while the numbers are still small, it's going to be to everybody's benefit, because if this takes off like they want it to, then we don't want to be doing this a year from now for that many students.Sheila Burleson: Is that affecting all packaging, budget, and tracking?Angie Daugherty: It doesn't impact their raw rec tracking, but it does budget, it does awards.Sheila Burleson: Those groupings, the packaging and the budget groups that are affected, okay.Kenneth Kirksey: Well, when you review those, I might want to be in on that meeting.Angie Daugherty: Okay, I'll set up something with Jonathan and you next week, and we can go over your list.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. Sounds like a plan.Alison Rabil: Which just made me think, for summer, we need to take PKH out of there. We need to take online programs out of there, and PKH out of there. So we just need to make a note that if we're packaging people, we're not including them in the grant aid stuff. So I don't know how that works.Kenneth Kirksey: So, no PK packaging?Alison Rabil: Well, we need to package them, but they only get… they would get Pell, State… they wouldn't get any institutional aid.Sheila Burleson: And we did that across the board for online, didn't we?Alison Rabil: Anybody online, including PKH.Kenneth Kirksey: Alright, so they only get…Alison Rabil: They get everything except institutional, so they would get Pell, they would get state aid, they would get loan aid. Yeah. That'd be it. What they get now, basically.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay, it's 10:59. I can go ahead and add these. Y'all won't have to stay on the line. We'll just pick up next week.Sheila Burleson: Thanks, all!Kenneth Kirksey: Yep, thank you very much. We've got a process here.Alison Rabil: Yay, I'm gonna go get my car.Kenneth Kirksey: Okay. Y'all ready for it to snow?Alison Rabil: Yeah. Ready as we're gonna be.Sheila Burleson: I'm not going to Charleston this weekend, either.Alison Rabil: I'll have to let people know whether I'm gonna make it in next week, too, so we'll see.Kenneth Kirksey: Alright. See y'all later. Thanks.Alison Rabil: Bye.Kenneth Kirksey: Bye.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/processes/process_calendar"],"headers":[{"heading":"Financial Aid Process and Systems Review","level":1,"id":"Financial_Aid_Process_and_Systems_Review_0"},{"heading":"Morning Check-in and Condition 2 Impact","level":2,"id":"Morning_Check-in_and_Condition_2_Impact_0"},{"heading":"Converting Estimated Awards to Actual Awards (26-27)","level":2,"id":"Converting_Estimated_Awards_to_Actual_Awards_(26-27)_0"},{"heading":"Timing and Triggers for Actual Awards","level":3,"id":"Timing_and_Triggers_for_Actual_Awards_0"},{"heading":"Communication Strategy for Updated Awards","level":3,"id":"Communication_Strategy_for_Updated_Awards_0"},{"heading":"Technical Process for Conversion","level":3,"id":"Technical_Process_for_Conversion_0"},{"heading":"Summer Awarding Process (25-26)","level":2,"id":"Summer_Awarding_Process_(25-26)_0"},{"heading":"Summer State Grants Automation","level":3,"id":"Summer_State_Grants_Automation_0"},{"heading":"ACOG Awarding Strategy for Summer","level":3,"id":"ACOG_Awarding_Strategy_for_Summer_0"},{"heading":"Finalizing the Summer Processing Calendar","level":3,"id":"Finalizing_the_Summer_Processing_Calendar_0"},{"heading":"System Updates and Other Business","level":2,"id":"System_Updates_and_Other_Business_0"},{"heading":"CPOS Testing Update","level":3,"id":"CPOS_Testing_Update_0"},{"heading":"PKH Student Budget Review","level":3,"id":"PKH_Student_Budget_Review_0"},{"heading":"Clarification on Summer Aid for PKH/Online Students","level":3,"id":"Clarification_on_Summer_Aid_for_PKH/Online_Students_0"},{"heading":"Wrap-up and Personal Anecdotes","level":2,"id":"Wrap-up_and_Personal_Anecdotes_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-30-process-calendar-meeting-transcript.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769961991964,"modifiedTime":1769978452654,"sourceSize":26755,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2026-01-30 - Process Calendar Meeting - Transcript.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-30-process-calendar-meeting-transcript.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":95,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-30-scholarship-universe-weekly-update.html":{"title":"2026-01-30 - Scholarship Universe Weekly Update","icon":"","description":"From: Lindley Davis\nTo: Alison, me\nDate: Jan 30, 2026, 5:36 PMGood Afternoon,Scholarship administrators are officially in the production environment. I held training for all five college scholarship administrators this week. They were introduced to basic system functions and the reviewer portal. We had great all-around feedback!I'm building out our award manual as we continue implementation meetings with Lauren. My plan is to have very thorough documentation available by the time I go on leave.All Blackbaud rubrics have been exported and I've started the process of building them into Scholarship Universe.Reviewer guides and timelines are going out to faculty groups on Monday. I'll be tracking the length of time it takes committees to finish assignments. One of my goals is to reduce the turnaround time between reviews and awards. We're currently using the same timeline as last year while faculty get adjusted to the system and will look at shortening it next year.I've continued sending targeted communication for scholarships with low applicant numbers. We reduced the number of scholarships with &lt;5 applicants by 29% using these messages.We met with Becky, Angie, and Jonathan. I have a few reports to create to help them start the process of adding outside scholarships to the system and I am creating an implementation timeline for us. I'll be shadowing Becky at some point in the next two weeks to make sure I understand what we need to make happen for them.Have a great weekend!Would you like me to format another email chain for you, or perhaps help you set up a template in Obsidian to house these updates?","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#fa/awards/scholarships/schp_universe"],"headers":[{"heading":"Scholarship Universe Weekly Update","level":2,"id":"Scholarship_Universe_Weekly_Update_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-30-scholarship-universe-weekly-update.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769968962504,"modifiedTime":1769979232724,"sourceSize":1776,"sourcePath":"Finacial Aid Tech Notes/2026-01-30 - Scholarship Universe Weekly Update.md","exportPath":"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-01-30-scholarship-universe-weekly-update.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":96,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"finacial-aid-tech-notes/2026-02-06-weekly-scholarship-universe-update-lindley.html":{"title":"2026-02-06 - Weekly Scholarship Universe Update - Lindley","icon":"","description":"Lindley Davis\nFri, Feb 6, 5:34 PM (5 days ago)\nto Alison, meHello! This week consisted of wrapping up our cycle - lots of checks on scholarships with low/no matches, outreach to targeted populations, first contact with reviewer groups, and setting up the system for over 200 faculty members to start reviewing next week. Our final communication to students about scholarship deadlines went out today. I'll be monitoring the Finaid queue in Slate over the weekend to assist any students applying at the last minute. I'll have updated final application counts next week. I've put a few things in place to make this process easier for the future, including standardizing the committee registration template that goes out to all colleges. I've created a feedback survey for committees, which will be linked in their reviewer portal, along with their PDF guides. We use this information to build next year's applications and tailor the review process. I also wrote a sql query that will save us from having to look up individual Banner IDs in order to add reviewers. We have had good preliminary feedback from committees that we spoke with this week. The College of Business has been resistant to review in the system but the meeting Wendy and I had with Tracy Reed was very productive, and we plan to meet with several of their chairs next week. Ellucian added an enhancement portal, and I've been making good use of it, adding requests for features that will continue to improve our processes. We've begun discussing award methods with Lauren. We intend to start awarding students with renewable scholarships over the next few weeks.

The closing time would be always the same. The summer intent forms are tricky, and could change. Our Dynamic Form working group hasn't discussed any changing of time frames yet so no changes are official. Flight Path students have been using our standard form since that program came on board. This fall we created a form for that population for the first time.Here are open and close dates/times for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026.Fall 2025 Boone, HKY, ASOForm opened at midnight, on March 24, 2025 , the day after the Spring 2025 withdrawal date ended.Form closed at 11:59 pm on August 17, 2025 the day before classes began.Spring 2026 Boone, HKY, ASOForm opened at midnight on October 24, 2025 the day after the Fall 2025 withdrawal date ended.Form closes at 11:59 pm on January 11, 2026 , the day before classes begin.Spring 2026 Flight PathForm opens at midnight on November 15, 2025 , the day after Fall 2025 F2 closes.Form closes at 11:59 pm on January 11, 2025 , the day before classes begin.Note: Summer Intent Forms have opened in the past when the Fall intent opens. They always close at 11:59 pm, the day before the term opens.I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have questions or need anything else.Thank you,JayneNov 11, 2025, 3:42 PMHi Jane,I'm working on setting up for our 2627 aid year and have a couple of questions about the intent to not return dates. If the form closes at 11:59 pm on Aug 29, for instance, how quickly will those forms be processed and the INTR entered in Banner? I just want to make sure we don't stop processing INTRs before y'all get them all entered. Do you have the INTR form open and close dates for the 2627 academic year yet? Thanks!
